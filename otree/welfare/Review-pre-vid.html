            The questions we will ask you to answer involve another person. His name is Alex.
        </p>

        <p>
            Alex loves economics, and we are going to give him a present!
        </p>

        <p>
            He is going to get two books by two Nobel laureates in economicsâ€”Professors
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Milgrom" target="_blank">Paul Milgrom</a> and
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvin_E._Roth" target="_blank">Alvin Roth</a> (you can click each
            of their names to open their Wikipedia page).
            Professors Roth and Milgrom are professors at our university and have agreed to help with the study.
        </p>

        <p>
          Alex has already read some of their work and told us he has great admiration for them.

          The two books come with handwritten notes. But here is the twist! <strong>We have two copies of each of these
            books.</strong>
            One with <strong>original notes</strong>, from the famous authors themselves (Profs. Milgrom and Roth)
            , and one with <strong>fake notes</strong>, written by someone excellent at copying handwriting.
