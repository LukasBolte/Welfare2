<p>
    A small town in Arkansas experiences massive flooding, leaving many families homeless. To provide financial relief to the impacted families, the government temporarily increases taxes, including a $100 levy on John. John lives far away and <i>will never learn about the flooding or the relief effort</i>. However, he cares about helping others and would gladly contribute $100 to the relief effort if he knew about the flood.Â

    Please tell us what you think using the information provided above. This is not a trick question; we want to understand what you think about the impact that the policy has on John.
