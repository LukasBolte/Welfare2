          Alex will receive two books, either the two with the original handwritten notes or the two with the fake ones.
            We will return the two books that we do not give to Alex back to Professors Roth and Milgrom.
            They will never know whether the books they get have the fake or the original notes in them.

          In addition to the books, Alex may also receive a surprise bonus.
            The answers you give will determine: - which two books (original or fake) he receives - the surprise bonus.
