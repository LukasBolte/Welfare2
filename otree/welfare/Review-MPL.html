    You make several choices again involving Alexâ€™s bonus, filling in a table like the one
    below.
    For each row, we ask you to choose between the original notes, and fake notes with a bonus for Alex.
</p>

<div class="container">
    <div class="row justify-content-md-center">
        <div class="col-md-6 col-sm-8 ">
            <div class="img-container">
                <img src="{% static 'img/mpl_screenshot.jpg' %}"  alt="Table with questions" class="img-fluid mpl_img">
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>


<p class="mt-3">
    We assume that once you choose the fake notes for one row, you will choose the fake notes for all rows below,
    because the rows below simply make the fake notes better by increasing the bonus.
    You will only need to choose the row in which you switch from preferring the original notes to preferring the fake
    notes.
    You do that by clicking on the row.
<!--    You can also choose the original or fake notes in all rows.-->
