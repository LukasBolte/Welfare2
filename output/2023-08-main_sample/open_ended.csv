600604af2e88fb932d0b7aec,Yes,Worse off,No,"because they are indistinguishable from one another, it would be difficult to tell, but having the original is always better. His actual hands drew it in the original. Much more personal. ","because he doesn't live near the area and would be charged the $100 tax, putting him in a worse position.",because that's terrifying. That's what I fear life actually is. An alternate reality we are plugged into and don't realize it. That's just scary and I would never want to put myself in that situation. What if you couldn't come out for years?

Even if he would have freely given the money, they took that choice away from him and losing autonomy over your choices makes you worse off in my eyes.",That situation would creep me out and I would be afraid that it would give me a false sense of reality and I would end up struggling in real life due to what happens while in the machine.
5815767b0643a600016f0e72,No,Worse off,Yes,Because if the person never knows it is the original then they will never know that they have something valuable.,It made him worse off because he did not know where the money was going.,Yes because this would still ne a memorable experience even though it is not actual reality.

I would rather experience  what I want to experience in reality, not in a machine. "
611131e47725f6a04c723651,No,Better off,Yes,"Since the copies are indistinguishable, it makes no difference if someone has the original or the copy, unless there was a way to determine who had the original.","Because John is unwittingly helping out, so maybe he'd feel good about the tax because he knows it is helping.","Because even though it isn't real, I'll still have the memory of the experience, and it would still feel real to me."
603039c84bcf02e81ae8a052,Yes,Worse off,No,There will come a time when the drawing becomes distinguishable and this person will be better off then.,Taxation is theft. The government has enough resources that it doesn't need to add additional taxes. ,I've seen the movie The Matrix and it is not something I am interested in.
5c9293accd8dd00001d0b129,No,Better off,No,once wrd gets out that there are many forgeries  even the original would be worthless,As all those people far away get relief through the 100 dollar tax...if left unhelped some of those people may end up in the welfare system for years and bleed taxes that could be spend on roads and services that john uses.,real experiences in life are important. They need to be earned. Not through shortcuts
5cfc38f7ee119e001803dd01,No,Worse off,No,"Since they will never know the value of what they have is different than the value of the replicas, they cannot act in any way different. Therefore they are not better off. ","If John would happily donate $100 than it is up to him to make that decision himself, not the governments. Taking money without someones knowledge in any case makes him worse off. ",I think that I would get extremely addicted to the machine when I am out of it. It would not be a healthy way to live and it is playing with very dangerous fire. 
64135f3a5f83c8b43e569213,Yes,Better off,No,This is hard but I am going to say yes because you might want the authentic piece. ,I don't think it makes him better or worse off. I personally feel like since he is willing to contribute either way that it doesn't affect him.,I want to live my life for real so this does not entice me. Why would I do a simulation when I could go do the real thing?
6100d0faf8c8f22b10df3873,No,Better off,No,"If the copy and original are indistinguishable from one another, I'd say paying a much discounted price for a drawing that looks exactly like the original or could potentially even be the original is a great deal.","Since John cares about helping others, he would get a big sense of fulfilment assisting those in need with a $100 contribution. In my opinion, he is spiritually and emotionally better off by doing so.","Regardless, my experience would still never be real even if I didn't know it. "

Anyone with a copy can pretend it is the original, if they want.","If John cares about others, he won't be bothered about the $100. In the long run, the money used for financial relief will ultimately benefit society, and those who weren't directly effected can be reassured that they will also be assisted in the future if something similar happens to them.",I wouldn't want to experience something that wasn't actually happening. I would also be concerned that it could be addictive.
62b1ed31eaaaa61b18c69032,No,Worse off,No,I would say this question depends on what the person's intent with the drawing is. If they intend to keep it then yeah they are better off because they have the original and that means something to them. If they intend to sell it they are worse off since no one can tell the difference between the original and fake and because there are so many fakes the value will likely go way down.,John is losing money for something that has nothing to do with him.,I would not because it isn't real. I prefer to live in reality.
63ed1b44dc847ac2c0e41f82,No,Worse off,No,There is no way to prove that it is an original so it is no different than getting a copy.  Perhaps the novelty of this specific scenario provides some additional entertainment value for those that purchased.,John is worse off financially but as a person he might feel better knowing that his money is helping others,This would be dangerous for humanity and would change the fabric of our society
5df81cd72713055bdf02efd8,No,Worse off,No,Because the the original is now worth as much as a forgery.,He would be worse off in financial terms. It's not fair that John would pay a tax for something that is not disclosed to him.,I only want real experiences. I'm not the type of person who daydreams about fictional events.
5c55b95b91c0ad0001cf86ab,No,Worse off,No,"The person with the original is in the same situation as every else, since nobody can know where the original is.",He might have been able to donate that money in a more effective way.,"I couldn't know whether I would ever come out, so I couldn't go in and risk wasting all my life and the resources which would support it."
5ea95ca4936cd3035f7e3e3a,No,Worse off,No,No one knows it is the original.,He now has less disposable income.  ,Part of what makes the things in life worthwhile are the hard work and bad things that balance them out.
6274275522cd2c183be830b0,No,Worse off,Yes,"The original is much more valuable and though an amateur could not tell the difference, an expert, using professional methods could.  ",Because John is a good person and would donate anyway.  He would prefer that the government allow him to make his own donation decisions.,It would be the perfect opportunity to safely do something that I have always wanted to experience.
5e74e1df5ae15103a51a1ee8,Yes,Better off,No,The original one is worth more so of course they'd be better off.,"I feel like he's better off, it doesn't matter if he knows or not, we're all in this together and considering something like this may happen to him in the future, it all balances out.","The idea of coming out of that experience would be jarring to say the least. I feel like it would make me question my sanity or spend even more time in that ""fake"" world."
5c511ead2423780001086a92,No,Better off,Yes,"For pure profit no, because $250 ea x 1000 copies is more than the $20k for the original","Although Taxes were higher, using those taxes benefitted the local area much more and possibly helps keeps costs low for the future.",I would love to see what the machine would do.  It would open all sorts of fantasy possibilities
5ecbe5e254cc883c02f52be8,Yes,Worse off,No,Even though they do not know.  They have the illusion that they may have the original.,"It makes him worse off financially, as it is money out of his pocket.  But, emotionally it does nothing, since he doesn't even know what it is for.","I don't live in a fantasy world.  It might be nice for a few minutes, but then the letdown when coming back to reality, might be unpleasant."
6462c584d3863d452bc1f8d2,No,Better off,Yes,"Wether anyone can tell the difference or not is irrelevant.  You are paying fr that artists work, not the picture itself per say.  There are now 999 fakes in circulation that no one can tell apart.  That cheapens the artists work, not just monetarily, but dilutes uniquness and we are all worse off for it..","He would give the $100 either way and living in a representative democracy, we trust our polticians to do that sort of thing and why we vote.  As a society, any group that is improved is a net improvement for everybody so John is better off as we all are.","Even if you didn't know the experience was simulated at the time, you would know when you plugged in and when you unplugged so it is a voluntary state akin to hallucenogenic drugs. I think we should experience all things and the end of that is joining the collective unconscious including this simulation assuming one existed."
589a46af57995d0001a8a03a,No,Worse off,Yes,The person is not better off because they dont know they have the original and neither does anyone else,"He has to pay the money and he doesn't know that he is helping, so he is worse off","I would love to be able to get instantly happy by having an experience, even if it is not real."
645b64a4db6c2fa817932d6e,No,Worse off,Yes,"No the person is not ""better off"" getting an original and not knowing and unable to discern that it's an original.  They will never know the true value of what they purchased, no ever be able to sell it for it's true value if needed or desired.  This type of forgery is disrespectful to the artist's work and the integrity of true art collectors collections  ","Without knowing why the taxes are raised would seem/feel like a rip-off to John and be unfair.  For someone to agree and trust someone or an entity full disclosure about the actions or reasons for an action is necessary so that the participant can have the feeling of inclusion, choice or control over their own involvement.  To blindly take without explanation is crude and unacceptable","Yes, if the machine didn't alter me physically and I was able to retain the thoughts that this was imaginary once I was out of the machine.  I think this experience could be pleasant and be along the lines of a submersive video game or ride at an amusement park, allowing me to fully experience something without causing bodily harm or future hallucinations."
63bb4ea524b89495f4bad8af,No,Worse off,No,If it is common knowledge that 999 out of 1000 are forgeries then I must assume no art collector or dealer is going to want to take a chance on these items.  In my opinion the original is now worthless unless you have all 1000 and are sure that one of them is the original and then you have an original and a story to go along with it.,He is unaware of the use of the tax and being forced to pay it.  I believe he should simply be told about the flood and then asked to donate if he is able and willing.,I fear the experience would become addictive and reality would become unbearable in comparison.
62d43cee3d60ac98c1dcacc8,Yes,Worse off,No,Because getting the original Andy Warhol drawing makes the art piece much more valuable then buying a fake version of the same art piece and I think that the person buying it would be much better off buying the original one because of that,Because it makes him pay more money out of his own personal income which makes life harder for John which is why I think this would make John worse off,"I would not go into the machine because I would rather want to experience these things in real life and not in a fake simulated version by using a ""experience machine""."
63f7a84b6e32b3b093b7b241,Yes,Worse off,Yes,It could be worth more if they want to sell it. if they want to display it then its just the same,"If it is a mandatory tax, it will hurt many citizens when they can just tax the rich for this",I can experience things I would not be able to in real life without needing to travel or spend money
5ceac8abb5a9d90001c07ec0,No,Worse off,No,The overall value has gone down on these drawings and it doesn't matter if they ended up with an original if no one truly knows. ,I think they should let him know where his funds are going otherwise they can take advantage of people like this. It's nice that he wants to help but they should be upfront about it. ,That sounds depressing once I got out of the machine and realized it was all fake. I would not want to do that to myself and see what could be but that isn't how my life truly is.

No matter how close the fake is at the end of the it is still a fake copy. ,John would be worse off because he doesn't actually benefit from it.,I feel like that would mess up my perception of reality. 
628b8ef9ef5432197c27bbc9,Yes,Better off,No,Even though they won't know they will have an original among all the fakes.,He would be doing something he would already do but I think he should know about it.,After I leave the machine I would just feel depressed about the fact memories that I have.

55ad1d55fdf99b4c8f9941d4,No,Worse off,Yes,"They are functional equivalent, so there is no added benefit given no one will ever know.  It's actually quite a clever project.","As far as he knows, the taxes aren't helping others in a measurable way.  If he wasn't paying them, he could donate those funds to a cause and KNOW he was helping.  So we're effectively removing his ability to aid, from his perspective.  Unless he has enough money that he can donate at will anyway and thus it makes no actual difference to him.","It would be like a vacation, or watching a movie - in the sense that it's a time where you've chosen to experience something, knowing it's finite.  Yes, it bends reality, but so does dreaming, and it's not like I refuse to sleep, and actually quite like to dream."
63b6c0245a6de54b28e6ef89,No,Worse off,No,The reason they wouldn't be better off is because they have no idea nor will they ever know that it's the original so it doesn't affect their life in any way.,If he doesn't know then it could hurt his finances whereas if he knew he could willingly contribute to help.,I don't want to experience something that is not reality and be manipulated into thinking it was.
60fd6a2e013bff4b729c6dec,Yes,Better off,No,Maybe someone could someday know which is real!,He has helped someone that he would be glad to help.,I just think it's creepy.  I would be way too in my head about the whole thing.
6036a2f8ca97af126e1e0706,Yes,Worse off,Yes,"I think technically yes, the person is better off because they paid $250 for a drawing that is in reality worth $20k.","I think it makes him worse off because he isn't willingly donating. Even though he would have, he isn't aware and just sees it as an increase in taxes.",I think it would be really cool to experience things that otherwise you wouldn't be able to due to lack of funds. If you couldn't distinguish the difference then it would be worth it and would contribute to some positive memories.
631f3abc8826b6e7e8982648,Yes,Better off,No,"Why would you not be better off having an original copy? Isn't that the point of art, because the real original would be rare and special? ","I don't think it'd make him better OR worse off to raise his taxes without telling him why. It'd be an in between, because he's better off for helping people, which is what he likes to do, but worse off because his taxes are raised with no reason why. ",Why would I want to experience a fake life? And how would I not know I was plugged in if I was the one that chose which experience it was? This question doesn't make a lot of sense.

5ba259603bf2350001a54284,Yes,Worse off,Yes,"Because some day the technology will advance to the point of being able to tell which is the original, maybe not soon, but someday.","I think worse because he cannot make a choice to donate his money, and he loses the tax write off that would be associated with it.  And he does not get the chance for the good feeling about helping someone.","It seems like a safe way to experience something desireable, and since I wouldn't know it was ""fake"", that would be just as good as the real thing"

641386b1cb9a9c1e3569d4ee,No,Worse off,Yes,It really depends on what the person is planning to do with the drawing.

5ebe015ae70ab70008895dbd,No,Worse off,No,"Since no one can tell the difference between the two, it makes no sense to know because what would one do with that knowledge?  It can't be resold for value, it can only be hung on a wall as decor.","Raising Taxes on him when he is not a part of what took place is morally wrong, it's literally 'robbing Peter to pay Paul' as the the old saying goes. Also, the government does nothing temporarily and he will continue to pay the tax increase as time goes by.  I think the money would be better off spent directly on the flood victims rather than through an increase in taxes.",Reality is very important to me. Its great to be distracted for a certain amount of time or feel you can escape reality for a bit but in the end I think it will only bring some disappointments because we are trying to achieve something that isn't real.
6172b88315142e4eaa555c95,No,Worse off,Yes,"Based on the information provided, and assuming that neither the person who received the original drawing nor anyone else will ever know which is the original, the person is not better off by getting the original one instead of a copy. Since the copies are indistinguishable from the original, there would be no inherent value or distinction in possessing the original drawing over possessing one of the copies. The lack of knowledge about the authenticity of the drawing essentially negates any potential advantage in having the original.","Based on the information provided, the government raising taxes to provide financial relief makes John worse off. John would willingly contribute $100 to the relief effort if he were aware of the situation and the need for assistance. However, since he lives far away and is unaware of the flooding or the relief effort, he ends up paying the additional $100 tax without knowing that it's going towards helping others. This situation results in an involuntary financial burden for John without the satisfaction of contributing to a cause he cares about.",Individuals might choose to enter the experience machine for the allure of unending pleasurable experiences and the ability to curate their ideal scenarios without the challenges of real life. The decision might also depend on how much value one places on authentic experiences and the genuine human connections that come with navigating the complexities of reality.
60fcb2b45504d8488ab13968,No,Better off,Yes,The inherent value of art is in the experience of the creator and observer. The observer in this case is not effected in his experience of the drawing because he does not know it is not real. ,"A rising tide raises all ships, or whatever the expression is. It is better for all people that we live in a kinder, more helpful, equitable world. ","This was actually harder to answer than I thought, because I don't think it would be healthy to have that ability, I think it would probably be like a drug and destroy my ability to enjoy real life but I don't know that'd I'd be able to resist the temptation of a perfect simulation that would allow me to experience everything I want because it would open so many doors to things I'd never be able to do otherwise, even simple things like traveling because I couldn't afford it otherwise.

5dd4c2f2390fb648f7baf4d2,No,Better off,No,Nobody would ever know if it was original or not.,He cares about others so helping the cause would be okay with him and make him feel good.,I don't trust that kind of technology.
58d552e09dbe3f00012591f2,No,Worse off,No,They would never know which they received.,It would be better to let him decide for himself what to do. It should not be forced.,It would not be real so it is not something that I would want to experience.
647665d88d8d555b082b9604,No,Better off,No,"If the fakes are truly indistinguishable from the real one then I think the real one has essentially been lost.  Nobody will pay $20k for a drawing that might be real, so the value of all of them is $250, including whichever one is real.","John is happy to help, and the effort to relieve the flooding improves the lives of everyone, even if indirectly for those who aren't in the flood zone.","I would go in if I knew it was a simulation, but it seems like torturing yourself to make yourself believe you're having an experience and then realize it was fake."
5b211cda68a5ed000173e9c0,No,Better off,No,"If they can't tell which one is fake, then what's the point? They're all pieces of art, and everyone is in the same boat as to not knowing if it's real or not, so nobody has an advantage.","Higher taxes on John will help society in general, and John is part of society. He may be pissed about it, but he's secretly helping out other people in need, and that's what counts.",It would be depressing to come out of it and then find out reality is different than the experience.
5a78e410ae9a0b0001a97274,No,Better off,No,they are exactly the same as the original at a better price,he likes to help others so it would make him feel good and feel he's made an impact,it wouldn't be real and i would prefer the real experience
6331b9456956d880a1e4632f,Yes,Worse off,Yes,"Yes, they are, but without knowing that theirs is the true one, it would be hard to be happy about it. The original being indistinguishable from the others pretty much defeats the entire purpose.","Having to pay a tax for something that does not immediately benefit him seems like more government overreach to me. John could donate to the cause on his own, but likely will not now as he is being directly forced to pay more taxes.",I would go into the machine because I really like the idea and it reminds me of movies that I have seen where people do this like The Matrix and Total Recall. I just like the idea of escaping actual life sometimes. 
58f1017ac325470001795b01,Yes,Better off,Yes,They are better off getting the real one because it is worth a lot more. It is something the artist touched and created and would have greater value to it.,I believe he is better off for it because he would have done it anyway if he knew that he was going to help others.,I think it would be a good way to escape and give me something that I have been wanting for a while.
61283769a39dd638c256540c,Yes,Worse off,No,They could have it examined by an expert in forgeries and find out if it was real or fake and if it is indeed real get the expert to certify it and turn around and sell it for 20k.,"John does not know what his money is used for and as such does not feel agency in the decision. Although not materially impacted, he will lose trust for a government that lacks transparency.",I would fear someone could takeover the machine while I was in it and manipulate me somehow.
63d04a5f7878a7b80ffc1a23,Yes,Worse off,Yes,While the value of the original has tanked... it would make an interesting conversation piece,"Without the knowledge of why he is losing the $100, he is left thinking the government wrong him.",It would be interesting to experience things that would generally not occur in my lifetime.
5e84bd7c34d5d9072128fac1,No,Worse off,Yes,"The original lost its meaning as no one will ever know that it is the real one. It posses no unique traits, it doesn't have magical powers, it is just paper and ink like the others. ",He is losing 100 dollars that could better serve him and his family and have a more direct influence. ,"I could experience anything, things I would not normal be able to, and have the memory of it. I really don't see a downside to it. "
5d37ad921c16bb0015281337,Yes,Better off,No,"These questions don't really have a real answer, or an answer I feel like I can explain. I am going to say yes because at the end of the day, the person with the original, has the original. Even if they don't know it. (Which isn't realistic to believe that someone couldn't tell the difference somewhere.)","I'm not really sure how to answer this... I guess better off because he cares about helping people, BUT it isn't really clear that he knows he's helping people.","This just seems like a creepy situation, I don't want to be in any machine. I know that while I was in it, I wouldn't realize it, but still."

6162d7f2f4d650e7eec2e5b7,Yes,Better off,Yes,"The original one was created by Andy Warhol. The others were not, and if the person holds Andy Warhol in high esteem, this is an important distinction.","I am somewhat ambivalent about this one. On one end it is important to help others, but on the other end John is not directly effected and could be hurt by the lack of funds. ","I would be interested to see how realistic it is, but I would only go in a few times. I want to keep my grasp on reality. "
6465cd750298e0714b6391cf,Yes,Worse off,No,"Since the original and fake are both indistinguishable, I think this person is way too lucky to have received the original copy and they are better off having it too, and I also think it would be justifiable if they received a fake too since it is pretty hard to tell the difference.","Since John has no idea of the reason behind the increased taxes, I think it will have some negative impact on him.",I actually prefer my life and am pretty satisfied with it so I wouldn't consider a virtual world or some sort of simulation.
63f7cf04c7b1a4c4972e9254,No,Worse off,Yes,"If you don't know that you have an original, how can you appreciate it or be any better off?","Even though John would contribute if given the chance, he wouldn't know that he was contributing. The government is removing his ability to choose and is just taking the money. I think that would make anyone worse off.",It would be interesting to experience things that I wouldn't otherwise be able to afford.
5e07d174da6bad1342bafab2,Yes,Better off,Yes,Because what if they want to sell it one day and have to authenticate it?,Better off because he likes to help others and in the long run he may also be affected by flooding in the future.,Because I would like to experience how my life would have been without becoming a felon.
5b342c9da2982a0001dd9f25,Yes,Worse off,Yes,"The original was done by the creator, and was not faked in any way.","John has the amount deducted from his net worth.   Therefore, he is worse-off.",This machine would provide an experience that I could not otherwise be able to achieve.   Where's the harm in that?
632e9aa62793c18a857aece4,Yes,Worse off,Yes,"Yes, because it is unique despite no one knowing if it's the original. It will be fun to guess and discuss with people viewing it if it's the original. ",The taxes do no benefit John directly so it certainly doesn't make him better off. ,I would like to experience things I know that I will never get a chance to do in real life. 
63d18d8eafb7fb418594761a,Yes,Worse off,No,The original is worth the most and he would be better off financially getting the original.,It makes John worse off directly by losing money but better long term in case he experiences a disaster similar to this flood.,"No, I like real experiences. It would be in the back of my mind the whole time that the experience is fake."
63c16f0c495b7a4849e44651,Yes,Worse off,Yes,Whether they know it or not the original is worth much more than one of the fakes,He now has less money than he did before so he is worse off even if he doesn't realize it. However the fact that he would make the donation if he knew certainly enriches him somewhat as a human,I would not be able to resist  the temptation to experience different experiences that would seem totally real to me. 
5f96e38dbecb16000867dfa1,No,Worse off,Yes,Nobody would ever know if it was real or not,It makes John pay an extra $100 without his consent,"The machine sounds interesting, and would let me experience something that I may never get to in real life."
55aeaeb3fdf99b5c769f1f7c,No,Worse off,No,"He is in exactly the same state as those who received fakes and doesn't know if Warhol personally produced it.   He gets to enjoy the art, if he even likes Warhol, the same as if it were fake since it is indistinquishable from the fakes. ",He is financially worse off.  He experiences no sense of achievement or satisfaction because he doesn't even know about the flood or that he is helping them.,Although once in it I might not know I am in it and therefore would think everything is real I prefer objecctive reality no matter how unpleasant if I am able to make a choice beforehand.
5c1b97f889f0350001726def,Yes,Worse off,No,It's Authentic piece of Art.  Drawn by the original Warhol.  Much more valuable than a knock off.,Not knowing if the donation was spent properly.  Not seeing the flood would make me question where my donation is going to.,I want my life to be a surpise. No knowing or having the experience from a machine.  Rather have a real life experience.
6455192ec038073c909979c3,No,Worse off,No,Even if they have the original it has completely lost its value since no one can identify it. ,It hurts john since he has no idea why this money is taken from him. Even if it was a cause he'd be willing to donate to he would never know. ,If I think its real it will be that much more disappointing when I come out and my dream isn't a reality.  
62bd685ac3edc9ad0d77812b,Yes,Better off,Yes,I think so because he might be the lucky one,I think the government helping is better for John since he doesn't know anything about the issue.,I will go into the machine to experience how it feels like. It might be fun.
63213cae8cfeef4aa57d329f,No,Worse off,Yes,Since they don't know if they have the original they cannot sell it as the original. The vale was effectively removed from the original.,Any time you take money from someone you are making them worse off.,I think it would be an interesting way to experience something I wouldn't normally get to experience.
637d66726deca3adc9d0081c,No,Better off,Yes,"  No, the person is not better off by getting the original one instead of a copy. Since the copies are indistinguishable from the original and nobody will ever know which is which, the value of owning the ""original"" is not based on any objective distinction, making it essentially equivalent to owning a copy.","The government raising taxes to provide financial relief makes John better off. Even though John is unaware of the flooding or the relief effort, his willingness to contribute $100 for helping others aligns with the government's action. The policy enables him to participate in a collective effort to provide aid, which reflects his values and desire to make a positive impact, despite his lack of knowledge about the specific situation.",I would consider the option of entering the experience machine if the experiences it offers can fulfill my desires and provide a sense of happiness and satisfaction. The allure of experiencing ideal scenarios without the constraints and challenges of the real world could be tempting.
63b7566ea98814782bc51d9b,No,Worse off,Yes,"No, this person is not better off by getting the original one instead of a copy, as both the original and the copies are indistinguishable and carry the same visual and artistic value. The inability to distinguish between them eliminates any perceived difference in value, making both options equivalent in terms of the aesthetic experience they offer.","In this scenario, the government raising taxes to provide financial relief does not make John worse off, as he cares about helping others and is willing to contribute $100 to the relief effort if he knew about the flood. However, since he will never learn about the flood or the relief effort, he remains unaffected by the tax increase and therefore does not experience any negative impact.","I seek immediate gratification and emotional well-being, the allure of the experience machine's simulated reality might be appealing. The decision would reflect a balance between the pursuit of genuine life experiences and the comfort of a controlled and perfect world within the machine."
5a4ff86beedc32000141f232,No,Worse off,Yes,Since know one will eve know it doesn't make a difference. If it doesn't make a difference he would not be better off.,He loses money. He would give what he could afford if he had known.,Yes I would do it because it would give me an experience I would like to have. It would also be fun.
5d88f010859c9e0001810e88,Yes,Worse off,Yes,Because the original is a handmade treasure by an important artist. Even if they are not able to tell the difference it still does lose it's value. ,I think the answer if probably somewhere in between and is a moral neutral act and a neither a gain or loss. If he would gladly have given it does seem he really needs the money so no great loss. There is no gain because he does not get to feel good about helping. If I had to choose I guess a tiny bit of loss for being forced to without the feeling good part. ,For all I know that is all that is really happening now with my actual brain. Life could really just be the mind floating in an experience machine known as the human body and this would really be no different just way more convenient and with more choices. 
5589629dfdf99b72ead88339,Yes,Worse off,Yes,There is still value in having the original even if you don't know it.,He now has less money.,I do not see any downside. I can do things I can not do in real life.
5e00f9a211999fcea4169800,No,Worse off,Yes,Which ever version they believe that they have will govern how they feel and the ultimate amount of utility that they get from having the drawing regardless of which they actually have,He is unaware of the flood relief effort so he will gain no sense of having helped anyone. He is not effected by the flooding so there is no benefit to him there. He is out $100 so ultimately he is worse off,"Given that the experience would be ""real"" for me, I would not deprive myself of the experience. The experience would have the same impact emotionally as the physical experience"
5a381de00006450001bf2691,No,Better off,Yes,"Neither they nor anyone else will every be able to tell, so it's going to be treated like any other copy.","The small amount of taxes levied on John and others will help build societal cohesion. When something inevitably happens to John and his area, other far away people can repay in kind.","Why wouldn't you? It's the holodeck basically, you could do any stupid thing while still being safe, and feeling like you had really done it."
5d4254db5b2c430001418a3c,No,Worse off,Yes,"Because they are being manipulated by purchasing a forged copy of a famous artists work. In the long run, someone will be able to tell that is not an original and not worth anything. ","Worse off, solely because John and other tax payers in his community are being manipulated by not knowing that their tax money is going to this relief effort. It can cause problems down the road and political division. ",I think it would be very interesting to try an experience like this. And you could eat without obtaining calories. 
61523fa4dff0567aa388e758,Yes,Worse off,No,"Since there is only one original copy, only one person can actually have it and that is or once was worth $20K. Saturating the market with 999 fakes may lower it's market value but the authentic value of having a piece from an iconic artist still stands as important.",John just knows his taxes are going up without any connection to where the money is being spent. He gets no altruistic benefit from charitable giving because he doesn't know its actually happening.,"This is the same as any sci-fi or virtual reality movie where the main character chooses the alternate life until it messes with his actual life and disappointment sets in because it isn't real. At some level, you internally know it isn't real so pretending or fooling yourself won't last."
6337ea706606e30e6f01592f,No,Worse off,Yes,"There is no way to know if they have the original. Besides that, with all the fake copies being indistinguishable from the real, that would make the real copy lose its value as well.","It takes extra money from him, but doesn't directly affect him. So, he's out money for no return that is visible in his everyday life.","I would believe that it was the real world, hence the experience would be as though I was having it in real life. "
5eb81d360943fe74d6aba62b,No,Better off,Yes,The person has nothing to gain from receiving an original instead of a copy as it is indistinguishable from the forgeries.,"In this case, John being better or worse off is a matter of perspective, and from the perspective of John, he is better off donating.","I think that if you would never be aware otherwise, that perception would become your reality. The benefit of experiencing a desirable scenario in contrast to a reality of an unpredictable nature is preferential."
6272abac31a465b0f22fb7c1,Yes,Worse off,Yes,"The original has more ""soul"" in it I believe. ",it makes him worse off financially but on the other hand he is helping. Since he doesn't get any benefit for himself I would say he is worse off. ,I feel like it would give me experiences that I otherwise would not have. 
5e3bb7770e53243ce0376fe1,No,Worse off,Yes,There is basically no advantage of having the original due to the fact that it would be impossible to prove.,"They are taking money away from John. Even though he would gladly help, he isn't aware of where the money is going. ",There are many things in this life that I will never be able to experience. This would be an amazing opportunity to actually live the experience.
629aaa38fdfc8168501b930e,No,Better off,No,"The person will never know if they really have the original, so that doubt would prevent them from being better off.",I think John would feel better knowing that his fellow citizens are receiving the help they need.,"I wouldn't want to have an experience that isn't real, regardless of whether or not I know that it isn't."
57a2b3e1dcff7d0001c7d0dc,Yes,Worse off,No,"Even if they don't know it, they have the original, which is worth more than the copies.","Since he doesn't know that it's going to a good cause, he might think it's just an arbitrary raising of his taxes. ",That sounds like a nightmare scenario to me.
5f7d4a2c5db79d21c7d07240,No,Better off,Yes,"Since they are all identical, the person probably will not get any additional joy out of the fact that it's real. They will also not get any financial benefits. ","The financial relief makes John better off in an abstract sense, in that his money/effort furthers benefits that align with his values. ",I think it might be motivating to experience something that I'm hoping for.
637ebcb105dec9012b030bd7,No,Worse off,Yes,Because the original drawing is indistinguishable from the copies so having the original makes no difference.,I think there should have been a third option - both worse and better off. Worse off because John is out the $100 and if he is on a fixed income that loss could mean a lot to him. But he is also better off because he knows that money went to help someone.,"Because we all have dreams of experiences we would love to have or careers we would love to have that are unobtainable. This seems like a great opportunity to have these experiences as long as you get to chose what the experience will be, not one chosen for you."
558955ebfdf99b6bd06016c9,Yes,Worse off,No,"I think technically they are better off by receiving the authentic work, even if they are not aware of its 'benefits' of authenticity.",John is taxed without knowledge of where his additional tax is going and is taxed through government middle-man process.,I do not wish to alter my reality. I think I would become too attached to the ideal experience from the machine and it would harm my mental health in reality.
55dc915b50a1f7001190ddb4,Yes,Worse off,Yes,"Um, it's an original?  Why wouldn't he be better off?  This survey is beyond annoying.",He doesn't live near any floods,Why wouldn't I want to be in a paradise scenario?  
62e02660c3ef175825ab7655,Yes,Worse off,No,"It includes the spirit of intention in that item, like it could be haunted or some shit.",because after the people are or are not helped they tax will always remain and will be compounding.,The grief of loss upon exiting the machine would be torture. 
62865960812a0a8c397f9b28,Yes,Better off,Yes,Original would always worth more,We should help the people in need,I want to experience new things.
605247e21ff59d8d1d6887fd,No,Worse off,No,They aren't better off because the value in this case is extrinsic. If no one can recognize the value of the original it is effectively doesnt not have the value of being the original.,"The money he spends wouldn't affect him directly, and wouldn't make his immediate surroundings (society) better. ","I find it more rewarding to achieve the desirable scenario on my own, and also would think about how this would affect the people in my life if I wasn't present "
5dd309d351c6d23192626706,No,Worse off,Yes,"Since no one knows which is real and which is fake, it takes away the value of the original.","Although he would like to help, he still is losing $100 and doesn't realize it's for a greater good.",It would give me the opportunity to experience something that may never happen in real life.
60838e2e91a6300001f9ac89,No,Worse off,No,"If it is indistinguishable, then even a professional would not know, therefore this person is no better off than anyone else.","We already pay taxes for these kinds of things. Creating new taxes, whether it harms John or not will harm everyone else that it is imposed on. ",Because this sounds very scary and odd and I would not want to do this. 
6172ba772342dcc9343a29db,No,Worse off,Yes,"No, the person does not gain any advantage by choosing the original over a copy. As both the person and others are unable to discern between the original and the copies, the significance placed on owning the original drawing becomes insignificant. The lack of distinction renders the original indistinguishable from any of its duplicates in terms of perceived genuineness and value.","John's financial situation is negatively affected by the government's decision to increase taxes for financial relief. Despite his willingness to help, he remains unaware of the situation due to his geographical distance from the affected area. As a result, he is burdened with an extra $100 tax without the satisfaction of knowing that his contribution is benefiting others. This policy not only hampers John's financial well-being but also dampens his enthusiasm to support a cause close to his heart.","I don't have personal experiences or consciousness, so I can't make choices or have preferences. However, individuals might choose to go into the experience machine based on their values and beliefs. Some might prioritize authentic experiences, personal growth, and the challenges of reality, while others could be drawn to the allure of constant pleasure and ideal scenarios offered by the machine. The decision would depend on one's philosophical stance and what they consider most valuable in life."
5f2469423f17ce03bf6bec8b,Yes,Worse off,No,It is always better to own the original. At some point there will be a way to distinguish the original.,I don't feel that anyone is better off being forced to pay an additional $100. If a person chooses to donate $100 they have taken the time to evaluate their finances and decide for themselves if it is a worthwhile cause.,I would not ever want to experience such a machine. I feel that anything that alters reality is harmful to the human experience.
5d9373b0e04970001ab482da,No,Better off,No,"The only way the person would be better off would be if they knew they own an original, for the satisfaction. And if they knew it, then presumably someone else would also know it which would make it easier for the owner to resell it for an interesting sum.","Even if John doesn't know that his money went to help people in need, his money did help, and that makes things a little better in the world, and hence a little better for John.","I just don't like the idea of a fake life experienced only in a virtual way. I don't really see the point of having a body, living in a material world, and not using any of it."
5e0b388b15ef4037cebdecc9,Yes,Worse off,Yes,It is much more valuable.,The money was taken by dishonest means.  It should be John's choice.  Plus to take someone's money who isn't a part of the community is theft.  If that were the case CA could tax people from NJ for CA issues.  How is that right in any circumstance? ,I would be able to experience things I would never be able to.  We would probably be kinder to one another because we could actually walk a mile in someone else's shoes.  
56c984eb10a82f0006ffd111,Yes,Worse off,Yes,There would get greater value with the original and would have greater sentimental or monetary value from it.,John is forced to pay the increased taxes without knowledge of what it's going towards.,I think I would be able to have experiences that wouldn't be feasible or accessible to me regularly in real life.
5658d6d67d69570012dfe258,No,Better off,No,"Somehow I feel that getting a copy is in the spirit of Warhol's artistic work, from what I know of it. The things he did were so strange that it just seems fitting.","Using taxes for their intended purpose, which is to help the society as a whole, makes everyone better off. Floods in another part of the country still have an economic impact where John is, and it is best that his tax money goes to rebuilding anywhere that rebuilding is needed.","Because I would know before going in that it wasn't going to be real, and I would know when I came out that it was never real. It would be like being in a dream that someone else was controlling."
5eb074c7e612c1129942044c,Yes,Worse off,Yes,"Art is personal.  The creative energy and unique situation that brought that piece to life by the artist to the individual is unique, its binding. Replicas are just that. They don't connect time, passion, and purpose of the creator to the individual. Despite if the person knows what they posses or not its simply not the same. ","John isn't allowed to make that decision himself. Regardless  if he would gladly contribute $100 to the relief effort or not, no governmental entity should have that power to take from this mans wealth and make that decision without him.

So many scenario's/destinations I can imagine that I may not or will not be able to try within my lifetime is a solid selling point for me.

632aaef27780d596dc7e0a9f,Yes,Worse off,No,"Its a 50/50 chance and the person just got lucky to have the original, it could have been the other way round ",Though John would be glad to contribute $100 to the relief effort if he knew about the flood it shouldn't be imposed on him without his consent.,"I wouldn't like to come back to the reality of my situation knowing how it feels to accomplish my desires, which i haven't acquired in reality."
63f0fb9941434d10e8e4909b,No,Better off,Yes,"Because they're worth the same, and always will be.  I'm operating under the assumption that no technology will ever be developed that will be able to distinguish real from fake.","Given the information provided, John might be put out a bit (I don't know his situation) by the loss of money, but in the long run he's better off because that same sort of protection would be provided to him if he were the one experiencing hardship due to natural disaster.  The issue of tax expenditure and how we allocate funds is a whole separate issue, but I'm going with the scenario presented.","Because I'd like to experience a better life.  I'd be interested in seeing if a positive change in circumstances would improve my  mindset, or if I'd be the way I am no matter where I am or who I'm with.  Plus, it'd just be fun.  Who wouldn't want to do it?"
5fb69cacddba6408f81a9564,Yes,Better off,No,There is an unknown but very real essence to the original that the others will not have - even if undetectable currently. Future technology will reveal which one is real. ,The collective good raises the quality of life for everyone that contributes. John should feel accomplished and proud of his unknown contribution. ,Experiences - and items - are not as valuable unless they are truly real. 
627e7b6d33e1df14160c05ba,Yes,Better off,Yes,Because it's the original piece of art and was the thought product of the creator,"He would give the money anyway, so it's technically neither.","It sounds fun, to be able to live out any experience as if it were real. Like a dream, but more realistic."
5f8e374790bf7f212e779735,No,Worse off,No,"If they don't know it is an original then it has no value. they might be better off that they love the look of the art, though. I feel more neutral in this answer, but if we are looking at being better off financially then the answer is obviously no.","if he doesn't know about it then all it is, is him losing 100.00","if it isn't real then I don't see the purpose. It could make real life that much more difficult, knowing that some things are unattainable"
5b6dbd2384a7760001c9c7fd,No,Worse off,No,They will not know if it’s original or not so it would make no difference to them if they got the original.,"The tax would make John worse off since he is paying for something he has no knowledge of.  Even if he did know about the flooding, he would still be worse off after the tax even if he wanted to help.","None of it would be real.  Once I leave the machine, whatever I did inside would just be a memory."
60fec21e36a05990cfa8a715,No,Better off,Yes,it would make no difference if the person got the original print because making replicas brought down the value. unless the person was a super fan of warhol i don't believe it would be better for a person to have the original versus the copy,"it seems john not only has the means to abide by the raised taxes, but it seems as though he would be happy to help provide relief for the people affected. even though he's losing a bit of money, i think he will be better for it because it will help others and helping others will bring john joy","while i love my life the way it is, there are many things i did not get to experience that i would like to. this way i believe i would no longer feel as though i had given things up or missed out on anything."
6435b95691d542284002bc90,Yes,Worse off,No,I don't believe fakes would be 100% indistinguishable so the original is obviously worth way more.,"I guess the technical answer is worse as he is out $100. I he knew, perhaps he would think it is worth it and he would feel better off.",Not something that I would be interested in. I don't deal with that kind of crap and can't wrap my head around that.
6140d7cdf9bc6016591c2878,No,Worse off,No,If no one knows which one is real then maybe they all have the same value. There is no advantage to having the real one because no one knows which one that is.,"I think it makes things worse for John because he does not know why he is being taxed. When people have to pay extra money they can become upset and if he knew  why he was paying the tax he would not be worse off, in my opinion. ",I would not want to go into the machine because it is not real. I would rather experience something real even if it is not perfect.
6278700097208c3f1b717481,No,Better off,No,This person would never know whether is was real and have constant doubt. Douby would ruin the experience,"If John cares about people and wants to help, he will not always know where that help is needed or what is being done with public money in these kinds of situations. However, John is helped by bettering the situation in his state.",I would be disappointed when I came out of the machine and compared the experience to reality. Too much of a letdown.
5e3606315bfa435ce4d6246c,No,Worse off,Yes,There is no way of ever validating that the person has the original so it is worth the same as the copies.,He has $100 in his bank account.  He would be better off if he knew about the relief because then at least he gets the satisfaction of helping someone.,"Being able to just have a desired experience seems great. If I can't tell that it isn't real, it doesn't hurt anything."
5e42f74f5b772a18434cabf7,Yes,Worse off,No,I say yes only if they can prove its original. If they really cant prove it its not worth any more than the others. One more thing sometimes its the sentimental value thats counted even if the monetary value is low,Temporary is it really temporary ? He will be taxed more than 100 bucks thats for sure,I want to live in the real world. There is too much tech. I dont like it
63861659d989762ac18f4ace,Yes,Better off,Yes,"I mean, technically? No. But as an art lover, I'd still rather have the original, period, because if you love Warhol (which I don't, to be fair), he touched it. He made it. That's special, and can't be replicated.","Because having the whole country healthy and safe increases the health and safety of everyone else, even if it's only marginally.","There would be fun things to try, and it would be safer than doing them in real life, like bungee jumping or something along those lines. Or maybe I could eat a meal that I couldn't otherwise afford."
5ff8b291840bed124061d389,No,Worse off,No,because there are 999 other copies that no one can tell apart so it has no value,because he doesn't know why he's giving it and he doesn't have a choice,because it isn't an authentic experience. I'd rather live in reality and experience all of the negatives too. it's how we learn. 
6333657a797e9a2d19d4efd5,No,Better off,Yes,Who cares which is the original and which is not?,"It means that the government takes actions that could help John in a future situation, even if others would not choose to help as he would.",That sounds much better than the simulation I'm currently in.
5c3388fa01439b0001a0adfe,No,Worse off,Yes,"If the owner of the original has no benefit in anyway, either in money or sentimental value of owning an original, then there is really no enjoyment factor above any of the fake copies.","I don't think it makes John either better or worse off in the long run, but I do think he should be told what his taxes are being used for if the amount is increasing.",It would be an interesting experience to try. I would take on an experience that I would probably not have the means to accomplish in my real life.
63eba3f11d699385d1d4075d,Yes,Worse off,No,It's a mystery. It'd be cool to say you had an original Warhol and I'm sure most of those 1000 people claimed to although they have a .01% chance of actually having it. I mean I can assume it'll always be worth around the price point they paid and a cool piece regardless. ,"He simply has less money so he is economically worse off. It might help his mental state and feed him to do more good in the world, but speaking solely financially, he would objectively be worse off. ","For an hour every few weekends? Sure. Everyday, that's giving you a false sense of reality and isn't good for your mental state, complacency, etc. "
5a33d736bf4d770001e6097a,No,Better off,No,"I don't see how anyone benefits from this. If the person never knows they have the original, they can't get more by the sale of it than someone with a forgery.","Since he is a seemingly generous person who would gladly contribute anyway, I feel that by helping others, he is better off for it, even if he is unaware at the moment.",That actually gave me the creeps to think about. I wouldn't want to be at a place where I didn't realize what was reality or not.
5ed2bb7a67d51b24b2ac4037,Yes,Worse off,No,If the person knows it is the real one in some way then yes they may feel luckier which would leave them better off. Otherwise no.,John would donate his money of his own accord if he knew about the flood. Not knowing about the flood disconnects John's money from it's purpose in his mind which just makes it seem like the government took his money without reason.,I think that such a machine would be pointless. If I want to eat good food or if I wanted a successful career I could have worked towards those things in the real world and not in a simulation thereof.
63d672fd60ac772cd04cc33b,Yes,Worse off,No,because it is the original one and not a copy,Its more money john has to pay out of his pocket,Because i want to enjoy new experiences and leave to old ones in the past
6482c5058949aa16f72e52ff,No,Better off,No,"Since no one will know whether this person is holding the original or fake copy, they shouldn't worry about getting an original copy, I mean they're all original at this point.","Since John would gladly contribute the amount, I don't find any problem with the government taxing him because he would pay anyway.",I honestly don't like the idea of virtual reality so I don't really think I would choose to be plugged into such machine.
6155b9c45f96867d9d9631fd,Yes,Better off,Yes,We all are winner here. I love this Idea,Today it is about John but I can be the next victim so it is now my duty to help him and make sure that if I need help in the future I will get it. ,I would never know the truth behind whether it was real or not but the fact is I will feel real that's the matter. so it is worthwhile from my point of view. 
62348c41368404b2ade8312b,No,Worse off,No,"at this point, there would be no way to identify the original, therefore it has lost it's monetary advantage and value.  and all the drawings look exactly the same","the flooding doesn't directly affect John and thus the additional $100 in taxes he has to pay doesn't help him.  if he chooses to give $100 to the relief effort, that is his choice.  but if he is taxed the $100, he doesn't have a choice - he is paying $100","i don't like the idea of a false simulation.  even given the technology, something could go wrong to affect the outcome"
60a5717cc2ad303816870f66,Yes,Worse off,Yes,"Ok you say they are all indistinguishable, but I believe an actual expert on art and forgeries would be able to tell them apart so that that person could make a lot of money! $250 into $20k.....nice profit!","Well, I don't know Johns situation but perhaps $100 is quite a bit to him, so he may have to sacrifice other things in his life to give the $100 which could be detrimental.",I love technology and science fiction and virtual reality. My secret dream would be to have my brain uploaded into a computer and live in there forever so this machine could be a good first step!
612e44861dc0709ab9f444ba,Yes,Worse off,No,"If there was ever somehow a way to distinguish the real from the copies, perhaps by dna or something, it would be better to have an original rather than a copy.  ","I think this could be right with both answers, financially, I think he is objectively worse off because he has less money.  It could also be argued morally he is better off because of the feeling he may get from helping others, which he gladly would like to do if he did know so.  The issue with the question is he doesn't know so, so I have to go with worse off, because the financial aspect is the only objective one.  ","While I think this could be fun and a unique experience, I would not want to come out of the machine under the delusion I had experienced something I really did not.  "
58b5e6a0211f4500013aa42a,No,Worse off,Yes,I do not think it matters here since no one can really know which is which.,He will never learn that he helped and he will have less money. If he knew he was helping and could get some gratification I think he might be better off.,I think it would be cool to fly but not in a plane. Fly like how a bird flys and an experience machine sounds like it could emulate that.
5b96ec3a83bd380001b90417,No,Worse off,Yes,I'm going to say no only because this is a low value Andy Warhol drawing. The replication of images to make them popular fits in which the whole style of Andy Warhol. If this was any other painter and perhaps a more popular work of art from Warhol then my answer would change. ,John has no idea that he's helping and nobody he helps knows it has come from John. I can't see how he's benefited at all even if he would help out if he knew about the opportunity to help out. ,"What are movies, books, video games, etc if not less immersive ""experience machines""? I would certainly go into an ""experience machine"" if it had the capability of letting me experience my ideal experiences as there would be little chance of feeling most of them otherwise. "
575aee8152c3fe00091a6252,No,Worse off,Yes,It doesn't really matter either way as no one will ever know.,In the end it takes away money from him.,Because I would want to see what it is like.
63fd0a7da4c0df409be0a784,No,Worse off,No,"No. Because at this point its not rare, nor verifiable as the authentic copy. Effectively, they are all equally worthless. ",He's out 100 bucks. That's worse than 100 dollars richer. He doesn't even know about the flood. All he has is 100 less in his pocket. ,"I like reality. That sounds like a movie called Stranger Things or The Matrix from the 90s. People spaced out pretending they can fly, etc. No thanks. I prefer this reality. Warts and all. Life isn't a series of desirable experiences. The frequent rough parts make the rare good ones that much better.  "
616ef680ab8ca318a227f5ec,No,Better off,Yes,If they are indistinguishable then the original no longer has any value. It simply doesn't matter whether they got real or fake.,Because he would've voluntarily donated any way. He would be happy that he helped others and its temporary anyway.,Because it would fun to have enough money and not worry about anything. It would also be fun to see if a certain job I've dreamed of would be as great as my imagination has imagined it to be. It would just be fun.
57c304c04814b5000171d4ce,Yes,Worse off,No,"Of course the person getting the original one instead of a copy is better off. Fakes aren't better than originals, whether one knows it or not. ","The government raising taxes to provide financial relief could possibly make John worse off. John has absolutely no idea if the money actually being raised is going to a good cause or not. He can be told it is, but it may not necessarily be the case. ","I like to be fully aware of what's actually happening for real, not simulated experiences. Not being aware of what's actually happening around presents and high element of risk and could be quite dangerous."
55b645bbfdf99b1c02906873,Yes,Worse off,No,It eventually can be identified.,Paying more tax hurts people.,Would reduce read life meaningfulness.
61034787a79b4a6432034e1e,No,Better off,Yes,"They won't be better off because they have no way of knowing they have the original. In their mind, it could either be a nice art piece for $250, or, they managed to get a $20k original for far less money. But there's no way to verify.","Though he doesn't know where or why the levy is applied, he would have the satisfaction of knowing he is doing a small part in helping someone in need.",I think it'd be interesting to experience something that I might not do in real life. It would help broaden my mind and I could apply some information and experiences to my real life.
6365593d8f35fcb8f68d982a,No,Worse off,No,They paid $250 for limited edition reproduction. The 0.1% chance they got the original is meaningless.  The museum should have burned the original (because basically they did).,"John has less money and that is not his choice.  However even if he was given the choice, financially he is still worse off.  The question is vague (I assume on purpose) so who is really to say except for John... maybe ask him... ","This is some Matrix level shit right here.  If I had no family and I never had to leave the machine sure... but since I do, I will live my real life all the time thanks."
633da98587a07a61250574d4,No,Worse off,Yes,They do not know if it is real. It has no more value than a good print.,It was done without his permission or input. He would be better off if he was asked to give and did.,I think it sounds fun and adventurous. It would be enjoyable while I was in the machine.
5d4b265b72db9d0015e8aac6,Yes,Better off,No,"Although,the copies are indistinguishable from the original, there still may be a method eventually to differentiate the original from the copy. Thus, the person who receives the original one is better off.","It makes John better off because he would have contributed such money to the cause anyway if he was aware of it. Plus, such financial relief may provide precedence for John's area such that if a flood occurs in his area, he will receive relief as well.","I wouldn't necessarily never use such a machine. However, I would need more information on how this machine works before jumping into such a thing."
5f4d1371c20934977e621ac3,No,Worse off,No,Nobody know which is the original so there's no way the person who receives it would be better off.,"Worse off because all he knows is he is getting $100 less. If he knew it was for flood relief he may contribute, but he didn't get that option.",When I came out of the machine I feel like I would feel regret and betrayal. Like waking up from a dream and realizing it wasn't real.
55eb04337480920010aa9e0d,No,Better off,Yes,Since they don't have a way to know that it is the original they don't seem better off with it.,John is able to be helpful in a way that he is willing even if he doesn't know about it.,Since it would seem real I would want to have the experiences even if they are a simulated reality.
60ae732b911084864713db46,Yes,Better off,Yes,"Even though the two are indistinguishable, the original has inherently more value because of who made it. ","Even though John didn't know what the tax was for, he could afford it and benefits overall from having a government that provides relief to  communities.","I think it would be interesting and I would like to experience something desirable. Even if it wasn't real, I wouldn't know that and ignorance can be bliss. "
63bcf141136313265f65eec9,No,Worse off,Yes,"I think if no one knows which one is the original, it does not really matter.","It makes him worse off financially, but it may make him better off emotionally because he cares about helping others.",I would go in the machine just to see what is like.
58ac91c38bf22a00015b91b3,No,Better off,Yes,"No, since they all have same $250 value.",In the future John may himself benefit from such a policy.,I think we learned our lesson in the Matrix that reality sucks.
5d269fedf6dec40019b87a59,No,Better off,No,There is no way to tell the original or copy apart and thus it does not matter which one a person gets. ,John seems to be well of financially to help anyone in need and thus the levy would make him better off helping others without knowing. ,"I would not want to experience something that would be great but not real, as I could be depressed or disappointed with real life. "
5ef319f3058d7f0178266918,Yes,Worse off,Yes,Art is the most precious thing. It is hard to get original one. A copy is not bad.,Food and house is the most important things. The government should not increase taxes on it.,I want to experience the machine. I loved to try new things.
568c67547374ad000cc7448c,No,Worse off,Yes,They will never know and neither will anyone else.,John loses money and doesn't know he's helping others.,I think it would be a low risk way to experience things I am unable or unwilling to do in real life. It sounds fun.
5e9a2251a69f690b9cc31ede,Yes,Worse off,Yes,"yes because even though it said it is an exact copy, you would still feel good knowing you had the original. There is something special about owning something original than knowing it's a copy",technically worse off because he loses out on money and doesn't know. He won't know it's for something he cares about so he could see it as just losing money,because it sounds fun and interesting. I like the feeling of being in a scenario i would want and enjoy something
5a0c63e15d06850001affd96,No,Better off,Yes,Nobody will ever know which the original is. The value of all of them come down.,It might be John that faces flooding. Sensible taxpayers realize not every expenditure directly affects them right in the moment.,I would be able to experience things that I could never afford or that are physically impossible.
61639cbb5ffec1a6b93b2334,No,Worse off,Yes,If the person doesn't know then it doesn't matter which one they get.  If they found out in the future then they could sell it but if they don't know then nothing matters,It takes 100 away from him without a visual benefit. ,I think in a way our society is heading this way. I think there are times it could be very cool. I could visit a loved one that passed away or work through a devastating time for therapy. 
632f7d0761bce49001d13953,Yes,Worse off,No,Even though you cannot tell the diffence it still feel beter to have the real one,John is paying more in taxes but he does not know why.,I think this is creepy.  I alway want to be aware of the difference between maxe believe and reality.
6295343558bd17d19b11684d,No,Worse off,Yes,Since it is impossible to distinguish getting the original means nothing. ,Without knowing what it is going towards John. just sees it as money taken. ,The experience is real to me. Just like a good dream. 
63eaa6adf989350fb6225d79,Yes,Worse off,Yes,Because the original will be worth far more than the forgeries in the future.,Because he doesn't know about the flooding and all he'll now is that his taxes increased.,I'm of the belief we're already in such a machine.
608aede3203836ab453453a0,Yes,Worse off,Yes,"The person who has the original may never know it, but like it or not it is worth more than the other 999 copies. I imagine someone will be able to differentiate between the copy and the authentic drawing someday.","In the short term his tax hike would leave him worse off. He may be willing to donate the $100, but without knowing about the flood or why the government raised his taxes, all he sees is a $100 tax hike. This would feel inconvenient and like he's being taken advantage of.","I would go into the machine but not for relationship purposes with others. Things like food and travel are inconsequential when you find out it wasn't ""real"", but developing a relationship with someone or achieving career success could be heartbreaking if you discovered it never really happened."
5c223d4a4a7e1f000137e5b9,Yes,Worse off,Yes,"I think that getting the actual original is better than a copy. People want the real deal, not a mere copy.",I'd say that John is worse off because he didn't get to make the decision to give money away and he doesn't even know anything about the flood.,"I would go into the machine because I love immersive experiences. I also am a big fan of simulated reality, but I wouldn't want to do anything too crazy because I've been made sick from doing certain things in virtual reality before."
611e64ad7ea7083dd09ce1dc,No,Worse off,Yes,"No, the person is not better off by getting the original one instead of a copy. Given that the copies are indistinguishable from the original and no one will ever know the difference, the intrinsic value of possessing the original drawing becomes practically irrelevant. The perceived status or authenticity associated with having the original is nullified by the scenario's conditions.","The government raising taxes to provide financial relief makes John worse off. John's willingness to contribute $100 to the relief effort indicates that he values assisting those in need. However, due to his lack of awareness about the flooding and the relief effort, he ends up paying the increased tax without realizing his desire to help, resulting in an unintended financial burden.","Individuals' decisions on entering the experience machine would likely depend on their values and perspectives. Some might embrace the idea for the promise of continuous happiness and the ability to curate ideal scenarios, while others might value authentic experiences, real challenges, and personal growth, even if they come with ups and downs."
64360d6189dec3ac8afc9a78,Yes,Worse off,Yes,"He can get it appraised by a real appraiser and find out if fake of not. In real, he can make money of of it.",He's paying for something he doesn't even use. raise the taxes in that affected area only.,Why not have fun for awhile? I'm always game for new experiences.
56b4b565b2de2a000d3316ba,No,Worse off,Yes,"Since it is indistinguishable from the copies, there is no point in having the original copy since there are so many fakes out there that can't be proven as real or fake","I think it should be up to John whether he wants to donate that money to the relief fund, and taking that choice away from him makes him worse off, even if he had intentions of donating the same amount of money",I would like to see specific concerts without having to pay the ridiculous ticket prices and dealing with crowds. It would be just the same to me to have this experience I think.
602d3534af703b6fe8b4033d,Yes,Worse off,No,You are better off getting the original because in the future there could be a chance on somehow proving it is the original. ,Depending on John's financial situation it could be make him marginally worse off.,I have no desire to simulate reality even if I can't comprehend that it is being simulated. 
63d7c417a743f5ce28150f1b,Yes,Worse off,No,Because of the hype with the experiment the original would have more value.,He is down $100 so in the short term he is worse off. A small town is not important to the nation's GDP so his money isn't helping anyone economically important. ,This sounds like doing virtual heroin.

558fff05fdf99b3f7aada357,No,Better off,No,"If no one else in the world can discern the original, then having the original no longer makes it special. It will likely lose any inherent value it has as well because no one can tell real from fake, so its valuation will fall.",Society is better off when everyone has their basic needs fulfilled. John might feel the financial impact but society itself will be more stable.,I suppose it would depend on the experience but I don't think it would be a good idea in the end. The experience will eventually come to an end and eventually you'd come to realize that it wasn't real and this could mess with your mind and result in severe disappointment or potentially cause feelings of depression.
63b744d6c92e283f8b15993a,Yes,Worse off,Yes,"While we don't know now which is the original, if new technology is developed that can distinguish the original from the fakes we may know in the future and therefore at that time the original would be worth more money.","John is financially worse off because he pays more taxes. Those taxes are used in a way that does not directly benefit John and  so he, personally, is worse off.",It sounds like a great way to have new experiences.
6272f2124c61474d78e12c09,No,Worse off,Yes,They are indistinguishable so neither the owner nor anyone else would know they have the original. ,"In terms of material consequences, John is worse off. If he was made aware of his contribution towards the relief effort then he may receive some emotional gratification for his part, but that does not seem to be the case here.

The owner of fake or original one will never know what he/she possessed , and as piece of art they are the same. ","This is slippery slop. We definitely better off if all members of society doing well, so it seems like good decision to spread burden between all. But then government will do that every time for any occasion when government mistakes need to be corrected. So overall John will lose more than gain.

63d698af12a4d488c5fdf05a,Yes,Worse off,No,if they go to sell it maybe it can be authenticated.,money is taken from him without him knowing why,it is moronic to want to be thrown into a fake reality and tricked into thinking it is real.

He may happy to help others, but it is possibly he could have used this money for his own basic needs.",I would probably try it. It sounds like it could be a fun experience. I would hopefully enjoy myself and experience things I normally don't. I would be fine and it would probably just seem like a dream afterwards.

629e1dcac03690dc02e2859c,Yes,Worse off,Yes,The original is worth a lot more than a copy so this person is better off. The copy is essentially worthless.,"He is financially worse off in this situation, but morally better off.",I would want to see how realistic this machine is.
5eaecc764f192c59d0e8de52,No,Worse off,No,There is no one that will ever know which one is the original.  The drawings are no longer different and they are all worth the same. ,He is having to give 100 dollars when he does not even know why.  Money is being taken from him without his consent. ,Because I know this machine before going into it is not real.  Also what happens when a war breaks out or power grid fails.  Then I have to wake up.

5f0632802b566a17e81a5f5f,Yes,Worse off,Yes,BECAUSE THE ORIGINAL IS STILL THE AUTHENTIC ONE AND IT'S WORTH ALOT OF MONEY,BECAUSE HE HAS TO PAY EXTRA TAXES WHILE HE WOULD JUST DONATE THE MONEY TO THE RELIEF HIMSELF.,BECAUSE THERE ARE CERTAIN EVENTS GOING ON RIGHT NOW WHICH I CAN'T ACT ON BECAUSE OF LOYALTY BUT THE EXPERIENCE MACHINE WOULD LET ME HAVE THAT EXPERIENCE 
6400e78d52d3311f5456d932,No,Better off,Yes,If even the creator isnt able to tell the difference then one would assume that all of them are fakes,Depending on his financial situation I think it benefits John as he already cares about helping other people and aligns with his values,One could argue that what we experience currently is a simulation. The brain creates it own reality so why would that simulation be much different?
5fed6c9c0d786daf31f29f3d,Yes,Better off,No,Because he got what he intended to acquire ,Because he’s gladly help so it doesn’t cause him any inconvenience,"No because when facing back to reality, i would be in deep depression feeling like i lost that dream life. "
610ab7055a71ce72c0d66269,No,Worse off,Yes,because no one will ever know,because he would have probably donated anyways if he had known so tricking him or stealing from him without telling him isn't fair ,because I have always wanted to go back and see cool things in history so that's why I would get in
6044dfc230e44b5793804ba6,No,Better off,No,it's indistinguishable from forgeries,He got to help and he likes helping,I think we're here to experience reality unfortunately
5d851419d126db0001cf0396,Yes,Better off,Yes,Because it would be worth more. ,Because he knows he's helping. ,I want to experience things I would not otherwise be able to afford. 
5beccd423b6489000156596f,Yes,Worse off,Yes,It is still the original at the end of the day. ,John will lose $100 and not even know he is contributing to a good cause. ,I would like to have more good experiences even if they are not real. 
64458baefb18eef526894aa3,No,Better off,Yes,There is no way to determine the original and knowing there are 999 fakes makes this drawing worthless to take a chance on.,Government has to look out for all its people so certain taxes or fees that go into effect will most likely never affect everyone evenly. In the event John needs help someone else will be in the same situation.,"I would like to see what different realities would look and feel like. Even if I wouldn't know it's real or not, it would set a good perspective after that experience."
60b7bd75af8c92afa748324f,No,Better off,Yes,"Since the information about the original is lost in the mix of the forgeries, then the person with the original doesn't get anything extra for having the original.  The value of it being the original is gone.","In the long run, a system that uses taxes from everyone to help the needy when they need it ultimately helps everyone.  It helps society as a whole, so even if John doesn't need the help, he benefits from living in a society that would provide it.",I don't think there is a difference between a perfect simulation and reality.  So I would take a perfect simulation that only offers positive experiences over the random good and bad experiences of reality.
638b49928d017fbd9fd95ca4,Yes,Better off,Yes,The person did get the original. ,He is indirectly doing good,I have always loved simulated reality.

5d08f7e3c97bc4001a7ea90b,Yes,Worse off,Yes,"Yes, I think owning an original artwork is a very cool piece of history, even if you can't tell the difference between a real one and a fake one.","I think it makes John more financially worse off, because he is losing $100 that does not benefit him, but I think John is okay with this so it doesn't really make him that much worse off.","Yes, I think it would be a cool way to have experiences I might not be able to have, like traveling, or eating at a fancy restaurant. "
6317ac941faaf331c4573eab,No,Worse off,Yes,the original should be kept in a museum while the fakes can go in someones home. it doesn't matter if. you have the fake in your home and only a small amount of people are going to see it.,If it does not affect him he should not have to pay. It's a true scam on him and his freedoms and hard work are being stolen out from right underneath of him. he should be extremely upset!,I think it would be fantastic to somewhat experience some thing that I will probably not get to experience in real life. This would be fun to me.
636149c88d2d393decf957f7,Yes,Worse off,Yes,"Even though he has all the fakes he still holds the value of the real one at $20,000.",It is good to help others but only if you have the means to do so. Forcing this on John could have negative impacts on his finances.,We already play video games to escape like this. Of course I would take it a step further.
5e307edef5abed05e1736185,Yes,Better off,Yes,"By getting the original, they are getting the true essence of the drawing and not a copy.","I think in the long run, it would make John better off because he is helping someone.",I think it would be fun to experience something new that I've never experienced before.
607d6ad963c2b4e855ae2a06,Yes,Better off,No,The original is worth more than a copy.,He feels better about what is happening with other people. He likes to help.,I do not want to have a simulation. I want to have a real experience. 
5e6d8c46f93a0c35d1f82335,No,Worse off,Yes,no because they will never know they have the real one.,because he is 100 bucks shorter. who wouldn't be worse off after basically a 100 dollar loss.,"because I would not know it isn't real at the time, so it would basically be real for me."
6413679df656829532b4429c,No,Worse off,No,"No, the person who got the original Andy Warhol drawing is not better off because, since the original and the copies are indistinguishable and nobody will ever know which is the original, there is no difference in value between the original and the copies in this scenario.          ","The government raising taxes to provide financial relief makes John worse off. While John is willing to contribute to the relief effort if he knew about the flood, he's not aware of it in this case, so the tax increase effectively takes $100 from him without his knowledge or consent, which could negatively impact his financial situation.          ","  No, I would not go into the machine.

5b4370f330bbfd000105f991,No,Better off,Yes,There is no way to tell which drawing was the original and thus all of the drawings would lose any value they ever had.,At some point I would assume that John would learn about the flood if they were that massive and be happy that his tax dollars went to help those people out.,I would be interested to try the experience even though it would basically be just virtual reality.
5dd4189ef30aa640b4e9c094,No,Better off,No,"First, I am personally offended and disgusted that anyone would pay 20,000 dollars for that drawing. Anyone who would spend that much for so little, gets what they deserve.",John is better off if he knows that his money is going to help others.,"I'm a big fan of being immersed in reality. I am also quite imaginative and readily find myself lost in a good book, movie or show."
56f873d73592c7000b04d6fe,No,Better off,No,They won't know that they got an original which means they could never profit off of it in the future. ,I think it'd be better off as if John actually knew about the reason for the tax raise he would happily pay it.,I wouldn't want to do this as there could be issues that arise when I leave that stimulated reality. It could cause my depression or anxiety to worsen or it could make me want to stay in the stimulated reality forever.
64136bf30b27746cb96f7db8,Yes,Better off,Yes,"Well, it is always better to get the original one in this matter just in case you want to sell it one day. ","Since John would like to help, it would make him better off overall. ",I would be able to experience everything I really want. It sounds fantastic.

","i dont think either answer really describes how i feel, but worse off feels most appropriate because theyre taking his money without telling him the reason","i think being able to do something like that and not realizing its not your reality would engrain that somewhere in your subconscious. if used for good, you could really alter the way you live if youre convinced that has always been your usual"
5db783d50fcd4a000b1021e9,No,Better off,No,The value of an original warhol is in knowing its an original. If no one knows it is original then it takes away that premium status. The person is neither better off or worse off.,"I think it leaves john in the same positon. If he knew about the flooding he would donate 100 dollars anyway, so either way he is out 100 dollars.","People are built to want to solve problems. If there was a machine that gave you anything you wanted, when you wanted it people would eventually start to feel unfulfilled. I would rather be in the real world solving problems, and getting the satisfaction of working toward the things i want."
5ea48ae3461d1044f2d282cc,No,Worse off,No,"Since the orig and the copies can not be verified, there is no difference between them - thus this person is in same situation getting either. ","Even though he'd give willingly, the fact that he has no idea what the new tax is for does not provide him any feelings of good - he'll only think - crap - another tax increase. ",It seems to me that this could be dangerous activity - this fake experience may influence behavior and actions once back in the real world. 
611465b0cdf9e7bb34a05898,No,Better off,No,The only good thing about getting the original is that it would be worth more money if the person decided to sell it,"While it may be worse for his wallet, it is good for character development. He will probably feel better about himself after being able to donate.","I would rather experience the raw good and bad emotions of real life than simply simulate a fake existence, no matter how miserable I am.

62ec6448b97885449097b71f,Yes,Worse off,Yes,They may be indistinguishable at the current time but down the road there might be a method to find out the validity of the original versus the fakes. ,"Technically John would be out $100, so he would be worse off financially. ",It sounds like a fun time. I would have someone around me outside of the simulation to prevent me from getting stuck. 
62c4dbae8fb1ff9cd93a3150,Yes,Worse off,Yes,The person getting the original has an item that is worth a lot more than the copies.,He is being taxed for something that he won't benefit from,I think it would be exciting to at least try the machine. 
61705235c277934df17055e6,Yes,Better off,Yes,"Yes, because even though each person would think they have the original the actually person with the original is the real lucky one. To think it and have it is better than thinking it and not having it.",I think if he cares about helping then this would make him better off.  Giving the money is worth the feeling that they would have from helping.,The experience would be mind opening. I think to experience something that I could pick and would be incredible.
62896076149e8f156545884c,No,Worse off,No,"I see virtually no scenario where this person would be better off knowing if they got a fake.  On the other hand i think if they knew they got the original,  they could potentially sell that for a large sum of money.","It makes him slightly worse off financially in the short term, but in the long term this policy could help him if something goes wrong in the area where he lives.  I'm sure he would be happy if he received similar relief from a natural catastrophe in his own area.","First, I would be concerned something would go wrong and I might never get out of this machine without some kind of physical or mental problem.  Secondly, I wouldn't  want to have an experience that I know I couldn't duplicate in real life. "
5fdca41ecb769722e2266d8a,No,Better off,Yes,"Because it doesn't matter, does it? If no one will EVER know which is which, then it cannot matter.",Because John is naturally a generous person and would give the money without being forced to.,Because I would choose swimming in the Pacific ocean in Hawaii and I miss doing that. So to experience that would be desirable.
55ca03e1fdf99b2735fc1dde,Yes,Better off,Yes,"I don't believe the copies are truly indistinguishable.  Maybe by today's technology, but in the future.  Then the price for the original will almost certainly go higher. ","Because if there is a precedence there for the government to help the afflicted, next time it could be John's turn.  ","If I don't know, why would I care?   We all sit in the cave and watch the shadow plays, right? "
5d380f164803980016b2210d,No,Worse off,No,Because you can't tell it about so it almost loses it value because it indistingushable,He doesn't know about the flooding and will just be losing $100 which seems random to him,I prefer to live in reality and feel like my real life could of progressed with all the time in the simulation
5bc151ece6491a00013a21f3,Yes,Better off,No,The original is authentic. I believe if they're truly a fan it could be a source of pride or happiness possessing the original.,It makes him better off as seeing they're providing relief and the scenario could happen to John one day where he's need help.,"I think with a machine like that it could end badly with the person never intending to leave the machine, causing havoc on their reality and family."
615880a66bc32302998866d9,Yes,Worse off,Yes,I think since he believes that it is the real thing and this is what he actually has that he will them still value it as opposed to if he knows that there are so many other fakes. ,"I think that with the levy, he does not know about the relief effort so he will still contribute possibly but then he will have less money. ",I think it would be a chance to experience something incredible that you would never get to otherwise experience. 
5ced23c585712e00190bd98a,No,Worse off,No,In this case since they are indistinguishable it holds no value whether it is real or not.,I feel like John will not understand the tax raise and he would have donated had he known.,I prefer to experience life as it gives me experiences. 
60f2a2b4932fed5326988e0f,No,Worse off,No,Since no one knows which is which the person will not gain any benefit or prestige.,It makes him worse off because if he does find out about the flooding or relief effort then he will pay even more taxes than he is already paying because he may not know why they are being taken out and will unknowingly donate more.,I would not go because I believe this machine would distort my perception of reality and make my dopamine levels even more imbalanced than they already are.
609550ebd2fd05085720eca0,Yes,Worse off,No,It's the original and not fake. I'm assuming someone would feel happy they got the real one worth a ton of money if it could be determined so ,"it's less money in his pocket, so I'm going to say he's worse off (even though I support taxation for support for others)",I'm kind of delusional as a person and I don't really want to engage with things that enable this toxic behavior of mine 
5d0bb1874d659a0001391226,Yes,Better off,Yes,The original artwork is worth more inherently.,"The flood survivors are part of a larger population that without that money there are incalculable costs that they would experience. Things like jobs and productivity, education, etc. in the state would all be affected that although they wouldn't have an immediate effect on John, in the bigger picture they would long term. ",I think how you are feeling an experience is as important as the experience itself and this would give me a chance to experience something that I normally might not be able to.
5d63179aa3b94d0001da4bb6,Yes,Better off,No,The person is better off getting the original one because it's worth more money and I presume he expects the drawing to be original so he has what he expected.,"Although it makes John financially worse off, paying the extra tax benefits him because he cares about helping others. So in essence he is better off knowing that he is helping.",I prefer to experience things myself rather than be immersed in a machine to experience them in a simulated environment.
58635484a73baa00010db537,No,Better off,Yes,"I think that maybe the person might not be better off because if you could never tell them apart from the original, it would make it difficult, if you were trying to sell it, or if you did want to sell it some day because you wouldn't know if you had the original or not and maybe the value would come down since you bought it because there's too many ""copy-cats"" out there.","I think that since John loves helping people and even though he doesn't know about the flood or the relief effort, it would pretty much put him in a better state in the sense that he is helping others, but he's doing it ""passively"" as he doesn't know, but I think in a way that's a great way to help and I think that would put him better off because he'd be contributing and doing something he loves doing.","I think I would go into the machine because life has been difficult for over 10 years now for myself and my family. And I think that if I could experience anything I wanted, it would be to see my whole close family extremely happy. Like there was no drama, my mom and I getting along, my sister and my mom getting along, and my brother finally happy with someone who truly loves him in his life. I'd just want to see my family living in harmony, even for just a little bit and I think that's why I would go into the machine."
5ce9c6df6b2b3d001a94b24f,Yes,Worse off,Yes,The real drawing would still be the real drawing. ,"It would make John worse off financially regardless of how the money is spent, as he is losing money. ",This could be a possibility. 
6335d5ca73f2a684d5d10e57,Yes,Worse off,No,"I would think so, because if you can PROVE it is real, then you would have something that is worth much more than $250.","I do not know John, I do not know what $100 would mean to him. He might be much worse off without that money.","Maybe I have seen to many movies, but I would not want to do that. It seems like it would be scary."
63767a851344bd887e00249e,No,Better off,Yes,The person is no better off because no one knows or can tell that this is the original so it has no more immediate value than the copies.,"It really is dependent on John's financial situation. IF he is financially secure and he would have donated anyway, then I would say he would be better off as he is acting honorably and as a good global citizen.",I would do this as it would be a way to have experiences that I would never have the opportunity to have in the real world (eg visit Ireland).
6318be45a49442eee3a88cb3,No,Better off,No,They will never know if theirs is an original or a fake so it makes no difference that  they might have gotten the original.,John will feel good that he helped his neighbors and by neighbors I mean people would have been affect by flooding.,It wouldn't be real it would be just like a dream. I would rather have the ups and downs in my life than a fake dream world.
5d16ab9b59da87001ac41a61,Yes,Worse off,No,"I said yes as though I was a person who was an art lover because many of them feel that the piece has a soul and is part of the artist, so giving them a fake is fake.",I think you should have permission to spend other people's money. I know the government gives tons to Ukraine when we have loads of people living on the street and I think it is wrong.,This scenario has been done over and over from Total Recall to Vanilla Sky and it always results in chaos.

He might be better off in the sense that he feels relief that the impacted people are getting help and his money was part of it.,This would be an opportunity to have new experiences that might not be available otherwise.

63103bd06b5135122e25d6c6,No,Worse off,No,"No, a recipient of a copy of an Andy Warhol drawing is not superior to a recipient of the original. The duplicates are identical to the original, so holding the original drawing has no intrinsic worth or benefit over owning one of the copies.",John lacks the opportunity to volunteer and support the cause he cares about because he lives a long way away and will never hear about the flooding or the relief effort.,I want to want to rely on machine.
64148386b15c3ddfef1fcd69,No,Worse off,No,If there is no way to validate the original all all copies become valueless to collectors.,It would depend on if John knew the levy was directly in response to the flood and if they could expect similar help if they were in a disaster.  If they only saw an increase in taxes that would make John feel worse.,If there is no way to tell if the simulated reality is real or not there would be know way to know if you've left the machine.  You'd spend the rest of your life unsure if you're in a real reality or not.
628bb31571a8935ee2dbd6f9,No,Better off,Yes,Owning a fake does not give any type of positive feeling. Owning an original would be an amazing focus piece of the home.

642b00a2650a286366bd62fb,No,Better off,Yes,"No, because there is no way to distinguish that he has the original.","John will feel worse off because he doesn't know why he is being taxed.   Even though he would give willingly,  having $100 randomly taken from him would confuse him and possibly anger him.",Sounds like a great option to get access to experiences that I might not be able to have otherwise.
6447e654bd6048df347afcc2,Yes,Better off,Yes,"Because the original is ""the original""!! The copies aren't really worth anything. Probably not even the $250 they paid for them. Unfortunately no one will probably ever know which is the original.",Because in the future he may be in the same or a similar situation and it would be hoped that the neighbors would then have to fund the same for John. And depending on where the levy is constructed it may make John safer from the same destruction.,"Because I would not be aware of being in the machine, so it probably wouldn't matter anyway. "
60469275f75cd607f61fb973,No,Worse off,No,There is only one original.,He looses money but gets no gain from it. ,Reality needs to be experienced. Too many people already live in their own world.
627286792f25495f123cc27b,No,Worse off,Yes,No one knows which one is the original. No matter who has it they are all sold at 250 and now have equal value.,He does not know about it so the government just stole or taxed him 100 dollars and he does not know where it will be spent.,I like the thought of the simulation theory. I also enjoy video games and I think that being able to enter a game or simulation would be great. I also feel the real world is not doing great so it would be a way to escape it.
63978402e524eebeace93868,No,Worse off,Yes,"If no one knows or ever will, I would say they are no better off than the others, since they will never benefit from having the original ","He is paying taxes for something he has nothing to do with.  He should be told what he is being taxed on, and he should be allowed to approve or disapprove. ",I think it would be neat to experience something I would have no way of experiencing otherwise. 
644695d12dd99a1712dd84c0,No,Worse off,Yes,"Art is art. For a true lover of art, or a fan of Warhol, the percieved value of the piece it in the sketch itself. Somebody who can appreciate the work for what it is would be able to look past its ascribed value (regardless of authenticity), and appreciate it for what it is.","If John's financial situation doesn't afford him the ability to contribute to a cause he knows nothing about, then it would present a financial burden to him despite his generous nature and desire to help out.","If the machine truly granted what I desired, I could live an ideal life free of suffering, fear, and sadness. I would have true free will to experience whatever I wanted."
60e792f25e9ab875f9605cf5,No,Worse off,Yes,Because it is not identifiable there is no monetary reward.  There is only the enjoyment of owning a picture. ,John will be out $100 and not know why.  He will probably still donate to another cause not realizing he has already contributed for the year. ,I would be interested to escape to an alternate reality.   I would hope that it is a positive experience and not traumatic. 
63b75b3eace44d9b4bbe411d,No,Worse off,No,Because nobody knows if it is the original or not. I'd rather not own any of them than to always wonder if mine was real or fake. ,"The only benefit to John personally would be knowing that he helped someone, and that is not the case. In this scenario, he just loses $100 which makes him worse off than he was before. ","I don't like anything that alters reality and/or distorts my complete control over my decision making. I hate going under anesthesia, for example, and also don't drink alcohol for this very reason. "

Even not monetary value but historical value.,It may not effect him directly right now but in the future or someone close.  This is taking preventative measures of future losses.,I guess its not necessary.  Would not offer me much benefits. 
5db06709e8d5b50019c3bd88,Yes,Worse off,No,True matters above all. The personal touch of the artist has meaning whether it can be copied or not because perhaps one day there WILL be technology to discover which is the original and anyway it is important to defend truth even against all odds against it.,It takes away his personal choice. Even IF he would give the money himself it should come from him directly. Government should not be the middle man as it allows corruption to rise up in the government.,It is not real. I value true above all.
570bc1ffb9b52b00102db939,No,Worse off,Yes,"Since they have no way of knowing it is real, and it is statistically unlikely enough that they probably think it isn't the real one, they only get the satisfaction of being part of this project either way.",He will simply have a little less money without the satisfaction of knowing he helped the people effected by the flood.,It sounds like a fun and safe way to experience something difficult or impossible to make happen in real life.
5f888f1504ea37030833e9ec,No,Worse off,Yes,The person is not better off since the original and copy is indistinguishable. ,John has to pay additional $100.,I would like to experience what it involves. 
60ec601b8525af507f06373d,Yes,Worse off,Yes,"The person is better off because they have the actual original drawing. Even though they don't know it is the original, the fact remains that it is. While the creators cannot tell them apart, it is possible that some art expert may be able to. There could also be new technology that may be able to distinguish the drawings. If the original drawing is able to be verified at some point in this person's life, than their net worth will increase by $20k or more.","The government is raising taxes on John and are taking an increased amount of his hard earned money. John should not be forced to contribute, but rather have the choice to donate.",I would go into the machine because it would allow you to experience amazing scenarios that you may not be able to experience in real life.
63114fcf2fc8f4d507560901,No,Better off,Yes,"I don't care about original artwork, it all looks the same.","He likes helping, and he knows his tax dollars are helping others. ","Because there are things, like spending time with my first son that passed away, that I will not get to do without it."

55a7f195fdf99b7508d7d886,No,Better off,No,"I think it all boils down to whether or not this person has knowledge of their work being the only real one. They don't and never will, so they are essentially never will be better off for this.","I think John is essentially better off, because despite not knowing what his taxes are going toward, he is still ultimately funding a relief effort that he would normally support. The only way John is worse off, in my opinion, is if he can't comfortably afford the cost.","I'm going to say 'no,' simply for the fact that I wouldn't know at all that I was inside this machine when I had these great experiences. I think it would set me up for painful situations in my real life. For example, I wouldn't ever be able to taste the perfect food I had in the machine again, I wouldn't meet the people I met in the machine, I'd feel remorse for the experiences I had in the machine, etc."
63d13f416b2c25038c13007f,No,Better off,Yes,No one knows who gets the original so no one is better off. ,I say better off only because it gives John the opportunity to help his neighbors. ,I think this could be so helpful for people with grief and honestly so many other mental health conditions.   I would see those that have passed if this were real. 
63e52250d3c1483ed7be8ed8,No,Worse off,No,assuming that there is no way to tell the original piece then there is no value to it.,Less money on his pocket.,I don't want fake. I want reality.
607c9f94cc974d4ea1dc22c8,No,Worse off,No,"In my view, ""better off"" means authenticity of circumstances and provenance.  If I have no way of knowing the provenance of what I have received, there is no way to determine its authenticity. If there is no way to confirm authenticity, then, to my way of thinking, there is no value; therefore, I am worse off.","Speaking strictly in financial terms, John would be worse off because he will be out $100.","When given the choice, I choose not to subject myself to counterfeit experiences.

5fc6bf2fa7c6583abedfaf73,No,Worse off,No,"They don't know that they have the original, so they have nothing to gain from it.","John would have chosen to contribute, but he still loses $100 that he otherwise could have kept, so he is worse off.","This seems creepy, and I'm not sure there's value in choosing experiences like this.  Life is better for all the things that happen at us, not just what we choose."
63ea5be8b2ca91384436e184,Yes,Worse off,No,"Anyone spending even $250 on art is probably an art collector and for them, the original would matter.  For someone like me, it wouldn't make a bit of difference if it was original or fake, it would just hand on the wall and collect dust",John is worse off now because he knows the government can levy a $100 dollar tax on John at anytime. John doesn't know how much of that $100 is going to actual relief or to politicians pockets. ,"Because eventually you would un-plug from the machine and realize that it was all fake and could possibly cause a negative reaction (sadness, sorrow, depression).  If you were told ahead of time that you could plug in and choose an experience, I think that would be great.  For example, plug in and experience some super high priced wine.  Then you unplug and decide if that experience is ""worth"" the cost of the bottle.  "
5ba184ad35768a0001437bdc,Yes,Worse off,No,"They are better off because it will have more value, but they won't be able to tell it apart. ","It takes money away from John that he'd otherwise have for his own bills. If he would gladly give the contribution, then it should be optional and left up to people to decide if they can afford to give or not.",I would only want to do this if I knew I was in a simulated reality and not unaware of it. Being unaware of it is a drawback to the overall experience. 
6462e0c6e0c667845c37ec7a,No,Worse off,No,"If you can't tell the difference, or the experts can't, I guess they should all be seen as reproductions in the price.","Well, no matter if he supports the cause, it is taking money away from John.",I guess if it's something I wanted to experience I'd go for the real thing.  Just going to an emotion on a whim sounds loaded with areas to go bad.
55b645b1fdf99b1c02906872,Yes,Worse off,No,"The original artwork is always the first expression of that whatever, done in the hand of the human who imagined it for the very first time. If nothing else, it's worth more as an investment,  just for that reason.","It takes his money, leaving him worse off. Helping and knowing he's helping, and knowing who he's helping and that that person is worthy of his help, would make him better off because he made the choice using his own beliefs, attitudes, opinions and knowledge.","Fake is never real. Real is always better than fake since the real experience is much more rare than the fake, and therefore harder to experience."

It would be less effort to have taxes raised than to require John to make a contribution on his own. ,"If I was never aware that this was a simulation, It would be essentially real in my memory and I would have all the benefits of the authentic experience.

I would have to leave that ""reality"" I might be even more miserable without it. If I could live in that machine forever I would probably consider it"
60cb3c4b9454f7a196355088,No,Worse off,No,I would say given the price of $250 dollars I believe that getting a replica that looks the same or better than the original is beneficial unless you have $20k for the original.,"Because John would help because it is a cause he cares about, but raising the tax would mean higher out of pocket money every year.",No because I like to live out my experiences in real time.
55b9a9b0fdf99b6906d2aba4,No,Better off,No,If no one can tell between the original and the fake all of the copies would have the same look and value.,John is worse off because he doesn't get the satisfaction of knowing he's helping.,It would be too much like becoming addicted to a powerful drug.
5d30d94d6c17550001d3ba17,Yes,Worse off,No,Well if you could get it authenticated it will be worth more,He feels he is being taxed for no reason.,I think this is a slippery slope and would rather experience things for real
63d2cb67dfc2a799bbd30c69,No,Better off,No,"No, at this point the person cannot be certain one way or another. There picture is no longer distinguishable and is more likely than not a forgery. There is a benefit of having one of the paintings over not, yet not for the current owner who could not know what it was that he received.","I feel that by aiding a population you are better off. The world in a state of healing will ultimately make it better for those living in it. There may be no direct benefit to John yet he was able to secretly carry out his wishes, he lives in a better society, and is able to investigate where his tax dollars went when he gets the bill.",I would feel that this would circumvent what it meant to be a person. I would feel that something giving me everything I would want would be counter to the growth and ability to be a human. I think the constant gratification would be underwhelming and almost meaningless after a while. 
60abe580aa82f25a7acc9800,Yes,Worse off,No,"The original is worth so much more, even more than monetary difference. The actual artist did it.","John would gladly give of his own heart, but raising the taxes may upset him.","I have seen the Matrix. I do not believe in a Matrix world, but I do not want to be stuck somewhere and not know it's fake."
5f888a84d0200d03067e17ed,Yes,Better off,Yes,Because he got what he really wanted and would actually be satisfied. ,Because he would have done the same to help the victims of flood in that area.,Because I would like to gain such experience and enjoy the moment before coming to reality. 
63d3f99e6aab19fe9a92028e,No,Better off,Yes,"Originals are hard to come by, no one can get ahold of one in modern times ",If he loves helping people then i dont think think the impact will be large. ,I have always craved escapism so I imagine it would be worth it for me. 
628fde22d960fa7a63fb231d,Yes,Better off,Yes,There is history with the original that is not in place with the forgeries.,He probably feels positively because he cares about helping others and would have donated anyway.,It sounds like a positive experience. I would partake in it.
63cff43985317bac287a325f,No,Worse off,Yes,"Given that he had a 0.1% chance of getting it, I'm going to assume that HE assumes his is a fake. ","Financially, he's clearly $100 worse off. ",Hell yes! Plug me in!!
5a53d878acc75b000179e52e,No,Worse off,Yes,Nobody knows which is the original so there is no impact,He has less money and is not aware of how he contributes to help those in need,You could experience anything you desired
64415b7be32cc28f3d0364a7,No,Worse off,Yes,If they are truly indistinguishable then it doesn't matter which one anyone got because they'll never be able to sell it for more than the others.,He is losing $100 so he will be worse off.,There are a lot of experiences that I would like to have but never will because of various constraints.
57bf14513c449a000189c89a,No,Better off,No,The person will assume that got a fake. It seems there's no way to prove they didn't get a fake.,"One day John could need this sort of relief, especially with the crazy weather we're already experiencing. Also, I don't think we should depend on charity for vast public needs - the government should be funded to handle those situation.","I wouldn't trust any machine that has this much power over my mind, so no thank you!  Also, it's probably addictive and ""just the beginning of the primrose path."""

58578946c41fd90001434680,Yes,Worse off,Yes,That person is better off because they have something of substantial value even though they don't know it.,He's worse off financially even though he might have given that amount voluntarily. He's also worse off because the government didn't tell him what it was doing and why.,If it was truly any experience I desired I wouldn't choose food or career or anything like that. I would choose an experience like walking on the moon or flying into space or traveling back in time to an historic event. Something significant that I could never experience without the machine.
6318c6b8dd3d07c0fb9f0d18,No,Better off,Yes,"We assume the forgeries are indistinguishable from the original. So, whichever drawing a person has, they only know they have a 1:1000 chance of having the original. ","These taxes make John better off by creating a safer, less traumatic society in which John lives. People will flourish to a greater degree and because John cares about helping others he would benefit from living in a society with increased human flourishing.","I assume I would remember the experience afterward and know that I was in the machine. So, this machine would be a valuable learning tool."
62e0532289a4e5d9fedadde1,No,Worse off,Yes,"No, as he is unaware of attaining the original.","John is a willing helper, but as he is unaware of where the tax is going, he would simply be out of 100 dollars.",The fact that I would be unaware that it was not real could lead to some truly unique experiences that I could never have outside of the machine. 
546e3778fdf99b2bc7ebcff6,No,Better off,No,"No, because they probably will never know it was a fake. This man should go to prison for what they did.",It will help him because he wants to help and he would give the 100 to help these people.,I don't think so. I really don't understand that.
63d7ae296798556be9462358,Yes,Better off,Yes,"It is the original... even if no one knows it. The person may not be financially better off or know that they are better off, but this is the one that I think everyone would take if they could choose.    Also, you can't convince me that no one could ever know, though I understand that I'm supposed to assume that. With effort, I'm sure someone could figure out the difference in actual and fake aging.","John wishes to do good. He will be contributing to a good cause. The government uses tax money in much worse ways, so I'm confident that John would be glad his money was used this way if he knew. Society as a whole is better if we help each other.",I would get to feel what it's like to do things that would never happen in real life. Why not?
57ac740478a38d00017cce22,Yes,Better off,No,"Even though the forgeries are indistinguishable from the original, I don't think it is right to have the fake ones. I would rather he own the original one.","I think he would feel good even paying the $100, if he knew that it was going toward something like that.","I just wouldn't care for doing something that isn't real, even a simulation."
5d1d3f10d5669200017b4e46,Yes,Worse off,No,"It doesn't matter that they're functionally identical-looking. If someone wanted a copy of a Warhol, they'd get a copy. But if someone is spending $20000 for a real one, they are being deceived if they get a fake one. The deceit matters; being successfully manipulated and never finding out, might make the person unknowingly become primed to fall for deceit more easily in the future.","The $100 would go toward something he cares about, but he won't know that. He won't have the knowledge that the money he now lacks, went to something that would be worth spending that money on. ","I don't think it's a good idea to have that experience in the machine, and then come out and compare it to reality, in which that experience will likely never happen. I think it would depress me in the end."
6287a8c4a6303ff156cd0853,No,Worse off,No,"There is no way now to ever identify the original, so they will all have the same value.",The tax decreases John available income.,I would prefer real experiences to virtual. Virtual experiences have no value to me.
6034badeb512f97ce3682dc7,No,Better off,Yes,"The benefit of owning the original is only real if they (and everyone else) know they have it, otherwise it's functionally the same as all the copies.","It accomplishes a goal that John would approve of even if he never knows it, and it improves society in general, so he is better off.","I already indulge in experiences that aren't real (books, movies). This would be even better."
629531cb501e6d23d9797050,Yes,Better off,No,"Though both can be appreciated and the experience over all is part of the purchase, there is really only one ""real"" one, and the person who holds it has the true value.","Im of the mind that a rising tide raises all ships, so even though losing $100 may negatively impact John in the short term, by helping out the wider community it will improve the lives of everyone, John included.","I dont think so, I think its a sipper slope especially if I did not know I was in it.  That seems very dangerous to me."
610be0e8e3da02b00364c65c,Yes,Better off,Yes,"I would say the original would be best. If that person would like to sell that piece one day, it will be definitely respected more and obtain a greater price at sale.",I don't think 100$ will negatively impact John in the long run. For some people it may be upsetting but I don't think it will ultimately make people worse off.,I would give it a shot I suppose. As long as it is safe. I worry it could become addictive or damage my understanding of reality with one use though.
6392360efb6e254ffd31e722,Yes,Worse off,Yes,"Even though the drawings are indistinguishable, the original copy has a higher value because of its scarcity.",John is worse off because although he gladly contributes his spending power is decreased by the tax,I like experimenting with new technology and would find this interesting.
5edfbd316e98a72c5f5bdf16,No,Worse off,Yes,"I specifically dislike Andy Warhol lol. He's overrated and not a great dude. So in my mind, nobody is better off for owning one of his pieces haha","I don't think it makes him better or worse off but I had to choose one. I think his station remains the same after contributing $100. If he would gladly do it if asked, then he has the money to spare.","I mean, I wouldn't go into it forever. I prefer real life experiences over a simulated reality. However, if I'm sick, my chronic condition is flaring up or when I'm old and less able-bodied, why not?"
6431c58ce5be91cd5c2c5d8f,No,Worse off,No,"Because the original that he now possesses is now worth significantly less because of the fact that there are now 999 more ""originals"" out there.",He is worse off because he is now $100 poorer and received nothing of benefit for this.,"No, because in the end, I would have to leave the machine.  Once out of the machine, I may now be dissatisfied with my real life or circumstances."
5dd06a074ad3e2149c884661,No,Worse off,Yes,If no one knows it's the original and it will never be determined to be authentic then the benefit to the owner is the same as it would be to them if it was a forgery.,"He will have $100 less than before the levy without knowing why, so I don't see how he could be better off.","It would be a way to be immersed in situations that otherwise I may never experience, even if it wasn't real I wouldn't know the difference so the memory would be the same."
5a6d3a19e6cc4a0001b6c47a,No,Worse off,No,they will never know anyway. No one can tell so it will never matter in the future. ,He loses the money in a tax. He doesn't know it would have helped anyone. So even though he's helping he doesn't know it,It's sounds tempting but its not real. It's like dreaming about something you feel you are doing it but it's not real. I can't tell anyone I did it because it really didn't happen
5c6071a1e1df700001ca8bf1,Yes,Worse off,No,Because it is the original and the value is in having the original. A copy even with all that work is worth nothing. ,He has nothing to do with flooding so he is now worse off financially than before even if would be happy to give money to the relief effort. ,I wouldn't want to think something is happening that is not really happening. It makes me feel weird. 
5dea9fb3cb53ca1cda9f6116,Yes,Worse off,No,"They are better off but they may not know it.  If it can be proven that the drawing is an original, then they will be better off financially.","It makes him worse off financially because it is taking his money.  If John is happy and willing to contribute, then he might believe that it makes him better off because he knows that people are being helped by his contribution.",I would be more let down after the fact knowing that it wasn't real.  I wouldn't want to experience something fake especially if it is just for a fake positive experience.
6282575ebe32fdc6268babc8,Yes,Worse off,Yes,Those who got the fake were victims of fraud. The person who got the original is not the victim of fraud.,He is out of $100 due to the tax increase.,"It seems like something interesting to experience. So long as it is not harmful, I would not care whether the experience was real or not. We place too much emphasis on remembering rather than enjoying in the moment so whether or not it was real has no bearing for me."
5ab3fc4b5f01000001cb07e2,Yes,Better off,Yes,They will have an original artwork that has a lot of value.,We need to look out for the less fortunate.,There are many things I'd like to experience that I will never have a chance to do.
60fc2ec58ad0da367daee3c1,Yes,Worse off,Yes,They got the real thing instead of a fake for the money they spent. ,"I believe in this case, it would benefit John to know where his money is going instead of just having it taken from him which leaves him poorer. ","I would love to be able to craft ""reality"" however I wanted it. Even though the simulation wouldn't be real, I would love the freedom to live life however I wanted and be happy. "
5c0fdcfd3481220001de3039,No,Better off,Yes,Since they look the same no one is better off. Everyone gets to enjoy a nice piece of art. ,"By not knowing about the flood, John would not have been able to help. This way he gets to help and he will probably have a great life due to his helpfulness to others even when he does not know he did it.",It would be fun to experience what I want. This would be a dream come true.
5dc1d16946c7ba134f6626bc,Yes,Worse off,Yes,"Whether they know it or not, they have something extremely valuable in their possession. If they ever find out, they could be much better off financially.","He's going to have less money whether he understands where the tax money is going or not. Even if knowing makes him feel better, he's still down $100.","It sounds like a good escape from real life. If it can be any experience I want, I could definitely come up with something that would be more fun than every day life."
62fbeca46caf4abaaf74b5f1,No,Worse off,Yes,If they don't know it's original it doesn't matter what they got.,He will have less money.,It would be a unique experience to try something I might never get to do in real life.
63461a2e4fbbd9b9d80197db,No,Worse off,Yes,He is not better off since no one will ever know that it is the original and they are identical to the fakes. ,He is worse off since the money would be taken from him not by choice. John might feel like it was forced from him and perhaps he would use that money or more on other causes.,Yes that sounds great. I would be able to experience anything I am interested in without the knowledge or drawback that it is not real. 
5c91fc9c183fb70012f3510a,Yes,Worse off,No,Only the original one has any real value.,If John knew about the flood and would donate on his own then that's how it should be instead of more sneaky taxes.,Reality is already way too messed up. I don't need anymore fake experiences.
5d8b32e664ac880018630273,No,Better off,No,I guess not since it's impossible to know. Unless there is a way to actually distinguish it I don't see how they would be better off.,"Despite not knowing exactly where the money went, his money did end up helping others. I would assume that HE would assume that some of his taxes go to help people already.",It sounds like some sort of dystopian spookiness. I want to interact with real individuals and that's impossible in those circumstances. I guess it just creeps me out.
5c92aa671ce0cd00128c6c86,No,Better off,Yes,It will never be worth more than the copies and they are all functionally the same. ,The welfare of a population indirectly affects everyone. The area might be home to some resource that John benefits from. ,"I would be experiencing the event as if it is actually happening, and not be able to tell the different. So I would like to be plugged in. "
64abee38a80dfb5e45212487,No,Worse off,No,If the original creators cant tell the difference then why spend more on a possible fake.,He now has less money and the flooding is never going to affect him.,While it might be interesting for a few minutes it would still be fake so not worth the time wasted.
63d3fbf6aca63e00ed85d00a,No,Better off,No,"Since no one can tell if it is real or fake, I don't think they would be any better off regardless. People who see it will have different opinions whether its real or fake, so either way it does not matter.","I think it leaves him better off, even though he doesn't know what the money goes to, in his subconscious, he may have an idea it is for something important.

614dee533a453a96facba70b,No,Worse off,Yes,"Nobody will ever know which one is the original, and original art only means something if there is an emotional attachment to it, so it doesn't matter.","Unless John is wealthy and swimming in money, paying more will hurt. ","I don't know if I'm experiencing anything ""real"" right now. As far as I know, I'm already in another machine, and that machine might be in another machine. I might live in a young machine's toybox, I don't know. I'd take the best experience I can get."
633b0a148c59e60d29652fda,No,Worse off,Yes,The art world is rather silly.  Using this method the art collective made crazy profit.  No one should want to participate in such nonsense.,I’ve always found the government to be less efficient than the general public. The better outcome for John would be if he had the ability to spend his own money.  Perhaps a government outreach for donations directly to well respected charities would be best.,I would be willing to use this machine because the memories would feel real and allow me to experience things I could never imagine.  I wouldn’t even mind being fooled into thinking it’s real.
5941a894d304710001c3766b,No,Better off,No,"If they don't know, it won't materially impact them.","He doesn't know about the flood, so he doesn't know his contribution is helping anyone.",The long term negative effects of this would outweigh the immediate pleasure since you could not recreate it in real life
58064d91f25c440001678a10,Yes,Better off,No,"The original art is the work of a human being, Andy Warhol. Its value therefore is real, not fake like the other 999 drawings.",It makes him better off because as a citizen he benefits when the taxes of everyone are used to help Americans through disaster relief. Having a just and caring society benefits John much more than the loss of $100.,I prefer reality. The machine would in a way just be a trick that fooled me into thinking I had a real experience.
63d408a690705bd9c54c50a6,No,Better off,No,"If they will NEVER know, they are not better off.  ","While it doesn't affect him directly, doing good for others is important, and $100 will not make or break him.",Simulation could never replace the real deal.  
641adeb9f2a8a9f112571e78,No,Worse off,No,"The only way I would perceive someone being better off in this case, is if it WERE distinguishable; since they'd be able to sell it for more money. If no one can tell, no, ultimately I don't believe the originality would matter to anyone, since there are 1000 people who will never be able to tell.","He ultimately has 100 less dollars to his name. Even if it were willing, there is little denying that that is ""worse off"", even if a miniscule difference.","I'm not clear if this is a permanent choice or not, but either way, it matters very little to me. I don't believe that a fantasy is worth living(Except maybe when eating. Who doesn't want calorie free food?)."
6388fe254da991e17e7535ed,Yes,Worse off,No,Because it's worth a lot of money.,"He pays more taxes, making him worse off.",I like to stick with reality.  I don't need simulated reality in my life. 
5be1ac50ca095c0001b9f717,No,Worse off,Yes,Unless it can be authenitcated it is not worth very much,John will have less money now to spend as he likes,This would be a fun and safe way to experience things you can't in the real world.

5e9f2cd17c41440a2855a88e,No,Better off,Yes,Because art is all about the meaning you yourself assign to it.,Because if John is happy about helping others then it shouldn't matter if he knows he's done it or not.,Because if I think it's real then that's all that matters. It's still a legitimate experience that I can take with me. 
62e97dfea1a1ef00cb9f0b10,Yes,Worse off,Yes,The value of the Andy Warhol drawing will only go up in value,It may help in the long run but it will hurt his current financial state,Because I would be interested in trying this experience

I would be depressed afterward."
5d47abcc2dc88900166f27c9,Yes,Worse off,Yes,"Because the original was actually created by the artist and that has significance whether or not the individual knows that it is a copy or not, it is a connection to the artist that the copy will never be able to provide.",John is worse off because while his money is going to help others he is not aware of it all he knows is that he's being taxed versus the feeling of charity by giving his money to a worthy cause.  There should be a third option which is no better or worse off which I think pertains to this question.,Because I would enjoy having the experience whether it was real or simulated and I realize that this is counter to what I requested for Alex but I do believe that these instances are different since I can determine which books Alex receives.
602bff07a6fada440d3c4f6b,No,Worse off,Yes,There's two sides to this argument by not knowing if you have the original or not you somehow all equal. If no one's gonna ever know they have the original then it's a moot point.w,He is out 100 dollars and has no explanation for it.. If he knew where the money was going he may be better off.,I think it would be a great experience.  It would be something different and i am open to that.
565c6791c121fe0012fc3caf,No,Worse off,Yes,"There is no way for them to know if it is the original, so it's not like they can sell it for a lot of money.","He was not affected by the floods, but has to pay money towards relief.",I think it would be fun and cool to experience something that I may never be able to in real life.
59aaf1705e7f4800010eeec7,Yes,Worse off,Yes,"The original will always be perceived as more valuable than the copies.

Therefore, they can be sold at similar values in the same market unless every party involved is aware of the actual authenticity of the painting.",John seems like a working class citizen himself who can be impacted by a similar natural disaster in a similar economical circumstance. Why tax someone who has to work to earn money rather than rich people who passively earn income that can help other people and themselves?,I think I would suffer from an extreme depression when I returned to reality. My mental health is already too fragile to withstand much more heartbreak.
5e21e741f814784d3180f004,No,Worse off,Yes,It no longer has value.,He's losing money and not benefitting in any way??,My brain has been warped by poverty and this machine sounds like an end to pain.
5c3f0f042455ae000154cee9,No,Worse off,Yes,"The answer might be different if there was any way at all to tell the difference, but since one can't, they have the same sense of hope of having an original as the people with the fakes.",I feel John would be better off in knowing about the flood so he could make a free choice.,I would do it because I understand there are experiences I would like to have but realistically won't.
59528796a186be000114dc32,Yes,Worse off,No,The original has more meaning to it.,John is having his taxes raised that will not have a major impact in his community.,I do not think I would enjoy the immersive fake reality.
5f467b0a0d1aef037515c8c9,No,Worse off,No,"He will probably never know it is real or not. Also, that drawing is hot garbage. I seen better 5$ twitter commissions.","hes losing 100$, he will always be less well off because of this.",This is literally the concept of the matrix movies. Humans are not THAT stupid and will realize it's not real fairly quickly.

The government doesn't appear trustworthy without transparency.,"I wouldn't want to do that because my original body might be in danger at some point.

Additionally, since John is willing to contribute $100 to relief efforts, he has the means, and this tax increase will not negatively affect him. ","I just don't really believe that I should experience everything that I desire to experience.  I think that the limits on time and resources make the things that I choose to experience more meaningful, because part of the experience, for me, is the choice and the effort. "

While John would willingly contribute to the relief effort, the government's way of taxation without information citizens of the purpose of the tax increase would lead to resentment and feelings that big government is out to get the little guy.","When you emerge from the experience machine, you realize that the experience wasn't real.

Further, it stands to reason that less suffering elsewhere could reduce the chances of John suffering in the future as well.","I could write an entire thesis about this but, for the sake of brevity--no, I probably would not, especially if I would be unaware of the fact that I entered the Experience Machine.

63bde9862392eebaf64770c2,No,Better off,No,"In this case the entire point of the performance art piece was the ambiguity over which was the original and which was the fake; a person is no better off knowing if their Warhol was an original or not *in this specific context* because knowing either way would defeat the purpose of the project. Just having a real or fake Warhol brings less enjoyment than is added by the ambiguous framing of the collective's art project, which is an exploration of the concept of authenticity itself.

With the $100 levy, whether he knows or not, contributes to the greater good - which also makes him better off.","I think it would be cool.  I'm hoping following the experience, I'd remember what happened and make some adjustments to my life."

5c1980c24a03080001139d5a,Yes,Worse off,Yes,"There will be some way to determine the authenticity, at some point, so having the original has more physical value, as well as sentimental, artistic, and preservational values.","Worse off, but only in a minor way, financially.","I would want to test if it was truly working.

It will only ever equal the worth of the forged piece.",He will grow resentment toward the government for taking his money and not knowing where it goes.,I feel like the experience machine would give me good practice for scenarios that occur outside of the machine.

This is a tough one. The message clearly states that John will not know WHY the $100 tax was levied on him. So, to me -- if John DID know why, he would be more accepting of it.

5b75d448be28580001b5a603,No,Worse off,Yes,"The recipent would only be better off if there was a way to distinguish the original from the fakes.

"
64135e3d9cd5e3f16290d29c,Yes,Worse off,Yes,Because the original Andy Warhol drawing is worth more than the fakes.  ,Because he loses $100 in which he can use to feed his family.,yes because I want to experience new things and vacations as well.

6052961c99d0779f4f953050,Yes,Worse off,No,I think the person getting the original is better off because they could find out if their copy was original through scientific testing.

I think worse off only because John doesn't know why his taxes are increasing and therefore would be very unhappy about the prospect.,I don't know if I would trust that the machine would function seamlessly as it was supposed to.

This level of control could be enticing for those who feel powerless or dissatisfied with the unpredictability of real life."

62b055b8af4eda974466ad0d,No,Worse off,No,They are all worth the exact same at this point since no one will ever know the difference between the real and the fakes.,It takes his money without giving him a choice and uses it for something that does not affect him,I prefer to be in control of my body and actions at all times.
632f16551c905f94e05945bd,No,Better off,Yes,The question is what would happen to the original,So he wants to help people in need and understands that this is why the state increases taxes,I would like to try a life that is much richer than mine

60e7639e8eca5490df1e412e,Yes,Better off,No,The original drawing is the most valuable one.,It would benefit John financially.,It would alter my perception of reality and I would not be able to live my life realistically.

6475e3b08c14ba10d9e6f70f,No,Better off,Yes,Because no one knows the original copy was added to fake copies.,it is very important to raise funds to help families who are homeless because the massive flood destroyed their homes and John cares about helping people it's not a big deal for him to pay the levy.,Because you do not know you are in a machine you will think what you experiencing is real

The original will go down in value and people will be skeptical if it's really real or a copy.",John is better off because he is helping people in his community even if he doesn't benefit directly.  Sometimes we have to do stuff for the group's betterment and don't always receive a direct benefit.,I wouldn't want to go into the experience machine because I wouldn't want the VR scenario to be recalled as real and as if it happened.

In the other case, they got some unexpected surprise, but it is in their benefits, so it's better off.",I think it's better if he can know about the reason for the tax raise. Having it increased without knowing a valid reason make is worse off for him.,"Immersing myself in something that feels good for a short amount of time but is not real will probably make me sad to come back to the reality in which I may or may not have the same experience.

5f456942485340144549178e,Yes,Worse off,No,It is much better to have the original artwork from the artist himself.

5c11f3face422b0001d69416,No,Worse off,No,The person who got the original drawing is not better off because they will never know it is authentic.  This eliminates the possibility that they will ever sell it and realize the financial gain that only the real drawing could bring.  ,"John is made worse of in this case because he looses money to taxes, and he never gets the benefit that would come from knowing that his tax dollars are helping someone else.

62694f79608ed29b7af936b1,No,Worse off,No,The person has no idea the painitng is real so how can they be better off. The people who made the fakes where dishonest from the beginning,Worse off hes out 100 for a problem that is nowhere near him thats being dishonest. If you ask him for help i bet he would donate but your forcing something on him and taking away his choice.,The world is fake i do not trust machines with something this serious.

It's a piece of history, and while the others can surely be enjoyed for their beauty they're still not the same.","John is being left in the dark about something that would likely make him feel better. Regardless of where my tax dollars go I like to know and understand personally.

63cc5fddd5813c609d5b28d5,No,Worse off,Yes,Because there are too many fakes that can not be dedected out there making the original one less valuable. ,Because it's still should be his choice whether to donate or not.  He shouldn't be tricked into giving money. ,Because I would never know that it isn't real. 
644087beeb531ba7b10ae320,Yes,Better off,No,The original is always more valuable than a copy unless it was specifically the artist's intent that the copies be made and mixed in this way.,"We are all better off when families experiencing a crisis receive assistance.  After all, it could be our family some day.",I would be tempted to engage in unreality which would not be good for my mental health.

They all look the same and now there's 999 other copies floating around.,He still has to give money because of the taxes. It will make everyone worse off because they have to spend more money. What if they don't have that money? ,It would be incredibly fun. It would be like no other situation you've ever been in and it feels real.
629e1261dc860cbee1a8be12,No,Worse off,No,"No, because they are indistinguishable so they do not know if it is real or fake. Although, it is immoral to do such a thing.","It makes John worse off because he has $100 less than what he had before. He may need the $100 for his and his families needs. If John had the choice and gave the money than it would be different, but simply forcing John to pay the $100 is not justified.","I want to experience real life, not a simulation. In addition, I do not think that it would be healthy for my body to be hooked to a machine and not be active."
6152095d0b65b445c020dab6,No,Worse off,No,"Other than the benefit of enjoying the drawing as a work of art, given that there exist 999 fakes out in the world, there is little chance of any kind of financial benefit the person with the original would see, except perhaps for a later sale at a price that *might* be higher either due to some inherent appreciation in the value of the 999 fakes, or due to a later buyer wanting to take the gamble that the work may, in fact, be genuine.","I think that, at the least, John would *feel* worse off if he were to see an additional $100 levy on his tax bill. Whether he would actually *be* worse or better off is more a matter of his overall financial situation; an unexpected $100 expenditure could be a life-changing disaster or no more noticeable than losing some pocket change, depending on the person's level of wealth.","Although the concept is enticing, I don't know that making it possible for a person to have everything they wished for is such a good thing for that person's well-being. One need only look at the lives of the very wealthy to see that, by and large, they are miserable human beings despite their great wealth."
64789de1dfefcdfa1cc12542,No,Worse off,Yes,You dilute the value of the original through this process so the original is no longer worth the original price.

It only really matters if people can tell which one is the fake, or really know that it is a possible fake. If you know it there is a chance it's a fake, you'll probably not want the artwork, but without the ability to tell at all, it will make little difference on a basic level. But morally it would make a huge difference.","Raising the taxes makes John worse off, and he is probably annoyed because he doesn't know why it is happening and is a bit tricked.

63fa2f029381a13d9f2a36a8,No,Better off,No,"If there is no way to authenticate the original, then it can't be resold as an original. In my mind everyone has a copy because it's financial value can't be proven. ","By taking care of people in the region, all the people in John's area will benefit indirectly. This might include being more attractive to companies wanting to relocate there, tourism dollars being spent, educating the next generation of children who will live there.","The determining factor might be that I wouldn't know it was simulated and unconsciously, after leaving the machine, I might be chasing that feeling for the rest of my life, a bit like drugs. Now I'm having second thoughts because the experience could just be something minor (eg good food). Yeah, OK, I'm undecided."
647a79f26a3a291e6d70130d,Yes,Worse off,No,because the original one is kind of worth more than the copy one.,"Since John lives far away, will never learn about the flooding or the relief effort, and would gladly contribute if he knew, he ends up paying $100 without realizing it's going to help others, which doesn't align with his willingness to support a worthy cause.",i don't trust the machine that is why.
63d42d3563ac982cbbfe3300,No,Worse off,Yes,"It might be a mental, sedimental thing but as far as being better off it's a definite 'no' because if you can't tell and no one else can either than what's the difference in the end anyway right? ","Because he's already donating, it's kind of like they are double dipping his pockets or something. ","Because this sounds beyond awesome.

628e4f0118e498792b2ee35e,Yes,Worse off,Yes,There will always be some way to authenticate the original one so going with the original one will always be the safest.,Taking tax payer's money to provide relief to a disaster will most likely be a compromise by having to reduce another budget system that could've benefited John.,This would be like the steak scene from the movie 'The Matrix'.

Even though the drawings all look exactly the same, only one is the original which the artist's hands and pencil touched. There are people who are willing to pay a lot of money for that touch, much more than they are willing to pay for a replica. They are essentially paying for the artist's ""juju"" that he put into the drawing as opposed to just the drawing. Therefore, the original has more value.

Since the real drawing and the copies look exactly the same, and nobody can tell which is which, there's no real advantage to having the original. The original doesn't have any extra value because all the drawings are the same.","The government's decision to increase taxes for providing financial relief in the aftermath of the flooding has the unintended effect of making John worse off. While most people aren't fully aware of where their taxes are allocated, John's intrinsic willingness to contribute $100 to the relief effort showcases his desire to help others. The imposed $100 levy takes away his potential voluntary support, despite his lack of awareness about the specific circumstances. This might inadvertently undermine his sense of agency in contributing to causes he cares about.","Yes, I would choose to enter the experience machine, given that I have the option to select the experiences I desire.

The value of the original artwork falls to the same value of the fakes.,The Levy is not fair to John since the government should be using it's discretionary funds for financial relief. Placing a levy on John or anyone else would only open the door to future increases in taxes for unknown reasons.,I think that there are many experiences that I could have that I otherwise could not enjoy.

5992cb48de755e000116b084,Yes,Better off,Yes,The person buying the drawing expected that they were getting the original drawing and not a copy. It also seems unethical to copy this drawing 999 times and sell it for $250 each without the permission of Andy Warhol's estate.,John cares about helping others in this situation where flooding has left many families homeless and he would gladly contribute to this cause.

If they have a fake, they may think it's an original (since they are indistinguishable) and feeling of having that, whether one does or not, is probably the same.  He will most likely admire it as if it is an original (in this case it is), so he is no better or worse off, assuming he will keep it.","Even though John is out $100, it's gone to help someone.

If it were unknowingly replaced tomorrow, would anyone know? Would the people who would have been moved by the original not be moved of the copy. I don't believe that is the case. I believe it is largely a psychological effect of what we believe we are seeing, rather than what we are actually seeing.","I think it probably makes him worse off in the more tangible(to him), obvious ways.

The fact that I think it's completely real makes it even better. Although, I wouldn't use it for something that reality ruins.

62e151e072a7512b2a596883,Yes,Worse off,No,Because you cannot re-create the feeling and originality that the artist had when creating the original piece. There is more to artwork than just the object. It's about the experience from the artist's perspective while in creation.,What if John is on a fixed income and can't afford the additional $100? It's putting a strain on his finances and he loses his house? Who is responsible then?,Because I think reality is the best experience machine.

Simple supply and demand would mean that the original, now lost among 999 forgeries, is now no longer worth anything more than the other fakes.","Anytime ""giving"" is mandated by the government, the citizen who is forced to ""give"" is left worse off, and it would always have been better if the citizen opted on his or her own to give or not.","Nothing is said about how long I would be required to stay in the machine.

62f472ab95a96afabd6680aa,No,Better off,Yes,"If there is no way to tell, then I think the original and the copies are basically all the same value.

597b81f3de42bf000181db0b,No,Worse off,No,No one knows it's the original so there is no practical difference between having either.     Please note that both the video and the link are blocked by anti-phishing software.,John being taxed without knowing why risks provoking animosity towards the government. He might end up assuming it's for something he doesn't support and start ranting and raving about it.,"It sounds dangerous, both physically and mentally.

5fbd371dc57ae80a38ba00c2,No,Worse off,No,"Given the fact that the original one has yet to be distinguished, one can fairly assume that they all yield the same value. ","I think John is financially worse off by $100 due to the tax increase; however, given his altruistic nature, he would have derived emotional satisfaction from knowing his money was helping others. Still, he remains unaware and thus misses out on this potential emotional benefit.","I would choose not to plug into such a machine because I value authentic experiences and the inherent unpredictability of life, believing that genuine struggles and achievements give life its true meaning and depth."
61099a5c04f32c99f34ce2a8,Yes,Worse off,Yes,"The new owner of the original Andy Warhol drawing is not immediately better off because she does not know that it is an original. Viewing this work of art would inspire the same feelings whether or not it is a forgery. If, somehow, this original could be authenticated then the new owner would be financially better off.","If John has a low income then this loss of one hundred dollars would make him worse off. If John has a high income, then he would not be worse off. I think that the government in this case should let people like John know that their increased taxes are going to benefit flood victims, thereby allowing John to be better off through his increased happiness from helping other people.","I would choose a peaceful, inspiring experience so that when I emerged I would have experienced a physiological response that would have benefited my health."

He can't tell it from the others and has no idea if it is the original so doesn't even get bragging rights.,He loses money which means he doesn't have it for other things. He also loses the chance to make his own decisions. He would choose to help if allowed to so instead of just taking his money without explaining they could tell folks about the situation and ASK.,I'm not that trusting. And if it isn't really real then you have to really trust whoever is taking care of your body while you are in there. And also is it possible for the machine to be hacked?

5e0ff44218e8696f9f198d4a,No,Worse off,Yes,"My personal opinion about Warhol aside, the usual benefits of artwork are financial or aesthetic. If it's the exact same drawing, then the aesthetic value of the drawings are equal. If no one can determine which is the original and all of them might be, then the financial value is also equal. Whoever has the original is no better off.","Honestly, it's a wash, but that's not an answer option. He's better because he's helping, which is important to him, but worse because it's costing him more money. I'd tend toward worse because he doesn't know he's helping and the choice has been taken from him.","It's not clear whether this would be a permanent thing, ala The Matrix. If so, I might reconsider.

63474e67a5fd298c6103c409,No,Worse off,Yes,Because they cannot confirm it is original either way,it isn't johns responsibility to help the government should help,I think it would be amazing experiencing a different life 
63f2e107c4d0bc684b99d2c6,No,Worse off,No,Everyone would have a different opinion if it was the original or not.  Even experts would.,"Worse off because thats alot of money to take from one person for new higher taxes.  He could afford it because it says he would gladly donated it, but losing $100 would still not make him better off.",This is unnatural.  With vr atleast you know you are using vr equipment.

64618c94bd9b28ed7b6472ce,No,Worse off,No,"Materially, the person getting the original instead of the copy would not be better off if they're indistinguishable even to the creator. The value of owning an original lies in its being distinguishable and recognizable as such. ","If John never learns about the relief, it would definitely be worse off but an argument could be made that he would be emotionally better off even if he's unaware about it in the long run. ","I would not choose to plug into the experience machine. While it sounds enticing and tempting, I believe in making genuine connections and facing meaningful challenges throughout life.

5c3fd0d4c2d0b700017d02cd,No,Better off,Yes,"Maybe conceptually they're better off, but in reality, no... there's no discernible difference, so there's no way to know you got the original. Thus I can't imagine how having the original is ""better"" in any way.","So long as the government does a good job of informing John where the money is going, he probably feels good about giving the money and gets some positive life experience out of the money being given to a good cause since he cares about helping others.","I'd like to say no, but thinking of the experiences I could have that have a 0% chance of happening in reality, it seems worth it. There's just too much out there to experience that I know I'll never get in real life."

So in that case, nobody is better off or worse off because it's impossible to verify which is real and which is fake, becoming an extension of the piece in itself","Despite never being personally affected in any way, John would end up feeling better off knowing that he helped even in an unknown way.","Because escapism in some ways can be healthy., it can provide a temporary respite from the stressors of reality, and provide some kind of comfort or distraction if even for a moment.

60430fc782b5752a7ae8d797,Yes,Worse off,Yes,Because they have a copy he actually touched and was there at the original time.

Like, I wouldn't want to lose a year while in it, but if it were like 10 minutes and I would remember it to some extent afterward, it seems like too interesting an experience to pass up.

I don't like things that you don't get what you want because it may not be real.  I don't like taking risks.
6400dd2b5b4a2803b2fce1dc,Yes,Worse off,No,There is intrinsic value in the drawing having been drawn with the intent of the original artist that forgeries do not have. ,"He has less money. Moreover, the government has taken what he might have chosen to give voluntarily, leaving him with less options than if the taxes were raised. ","I think that we have a purpose in this particular reality, and going into the machine would be an immoral abandonment of that purpose for selfish pleasure. "
628eada3a9c9e0776884f27d,No,Better off,Yes,They will most likely assume they got a copy because it would seem unlikely they got the 1 real one out of 1000.,John will be better off if everyone is better off in society.,It would be fun to experience new things and for it to be almost like practice for the real world.
5a3b209b2f3c2500018bc67d,No,Worse off,Yes,"since you can not tell the difference between them, so they wouldn't know they got it nor would they ever be able to prove it",he would be worse all since he does not know what he is contributing to and therefore is not getting the joy of helping others,it seems like it would be an interesting experience
5cee02c4f19e6300175f8cbe,Yes,Better off,No,Yes because it is so much more meaningful to get something that is real and it is more valuable. ,Since John wants to contribute it makes him better off because he will feel better about himself.,I don't care how real the experience feels. If the experience isn't real I don't want to partake in it. 
6007a7996fbeef04ce080f90,No,Better off,Yes,Essentially the drawing is still from Andy Warhol.,It may make him worse off financially to some degree but giving to someone that disparately needs it provides immense joy.,"If I gain the experience of joy, love, thrill and it is pleasant to me there is no way I could turn it down whether it really happened or not. Sort of similar to having a fantastic dream."
61096a016b964e7af149fce3,Yes,Better off,No,"The person who got the original Andy Warhol drawing is better off because although most people and even the creators can't tell them apart, there are experts out there that can and if this person who owes the original took the time and spent money to have an expert look at it than the person would realize they have something more value than what they spent on it and could sell it for a profit.","The government raising taxes to provide financial relief will make John better off due to the person John is. If John knew about the flood, he would gladly give to help others which in return make John feel good about what he done for people in need and feel good about himself.",I thought I wouldn't be aware that I am in the experience machine and would believe that the simulated reality is real it still doesn't make up for what is actually going on end reality and that could affect the person in a negative way in the long run.
63d7ff8dba0dc23728426ecd,No,Worse off,No,They bought the painting they likes and should not really matter,He does not live in a flood zone and would never benefit,I do not trust machines to get things right 
6151e479b4ee16668948c7f2,Yes,Worse off,Yes,The person who gets the original is better off because he has the original.,The government took some money from John without giving him a chance to decide by himself.,I would like to experience something I did not have in my life.
566380241e460a000d5d09e9,No,Worse off,Yes,"If nobody will ever be able to pick out the original, all must be assumed fake.",It makes him $100 worse off because that is the amount taken from him.,"There are many hedonic experiences that I will never get to enjoy in reality, so I would certainly use the machine for those."
62dc78329e1358440d6c29a1,No,Worse off,Yes,"Because no one would ever be able to prove that it is the original instead of a copy. Therefore, its value can never be certain.","John would have less money than he would have prior to the flood. They are taking something away from him, making him worse off.","Because I do not feel that there is any difference from the virtual reality in the scenario or actually experiencing it. If my brain did not know that I was in it, then it would be as if it were reality, which is good enough for me."
63179fe6d8b52834c9c8f5f7,No,Better off,Yes,"I believe this because since nobody else is going to know, its not going to matter.","I believe that in this case, its done in good faith to help those victimized of this hypothetical flood.","I would be able to do things I would otherwise never do; such as take a trip around the world, and go on the moon."

5de7d7a6603b1b73f3944f8e,Yes,Better off,No,Because it was actually created by Andy Warhol himself and has more intrinsic value than the forged copies.,Even though his taxes are higher John is better off since he cares about helping others and would be pleased to know his taxes are going to financial relief for flood victims.,I would want to experience actual reality instead of a simulated one.
63b9d6746adc4bed24ff957f,No,Worse off,No,"If no one can tell them apart, the original now has no more value than the copies themselves. Being an original is what gives the work its value.",It makes John worse off because he was forced to contribute rather than being asked. It does not give people a chance to make their own good choices if they are forced to do it in advance.,I would not want to know that an experience that I really wanted to live was completely fake. It would be very disappointing once it was over.
610810c0356aacedc8cbc6f0,Yes,Worse off,Yes,"I don't think they would know they would be better off, but it is special to have something original made from the soul.  ","I found it hard to choose because I don't think it makes him better off or worse off.  I chose worse off because he would be out $100, which is not a lot but I don't see how it would be better off instead since he is losing something.  He doesn't get the satisfaction of knowing he helped people, so I don't see how John personally better or worse off.","It sounds basically like a liminal dream, which I have had before unintentionally.  I do not have a lot of money, so being able to experience whatever I would like for free would make it so I can have opportunites I would never get to have without the machine."
636efe3b7a4010c9eea5fb87,Yes,Better off,Yes,The person is much better off with the original as the other's are not real ,He is happy to know the the money given will help the people in need,I feel like I can explore things I otherwise may never get to do
61071cc46f4d7bb59e4b4c74,Yes,Better off,Yes,The image may be duplicated but the authenticity of it being the single Warhol drawing cannot. That person who received the original IS better off. ,"He is better off because he benefits from the relief effort beyond the cost of the $100, and that remains true whether he is aware of it or not. ","I liken this to a lucid dream. It feels real, it is totally immersive and controllable but in a way that my reality is not. I would like to enjoy experiences in this machine, and I would know when I am back in reality, even though it felt real at the time. I would however worry that this would cause me anxiety about my real life and how to cope with not having the best experiences. "
62734ce38db73cd5bd81a36f,Yes,Worse off,Yes,The original drawing is the actual creation from the artist. ,It takes $100 away from John without letting him now what the purpose of that $100 levy was.,I would like to go into the machine and enjoy eating all the foods that I love so that I could enjoy them without gaining weight and adversely affecting my health
63f3727c6e41f63c9b2a6f1f,No,Worse off,No,I don't think that getting the original is necessary since both of them are indistinguishable as no one will ever know if it is the original or a copy.,The new tax increase might seem a little high for John and I think it might be good for him to actually know the reason behind it.,"As interesting as it might be, I will still prefer to be in this reality and carry on with my life than being plugged into a simulation."
6389301d2575b8e4c1e7cc5c,Yes,Worse off,No,"The person would be better off with the original because one day he may decide to sell it. By going to the correct art appraiser, they would be able to tell an original from the fake. Besides he may want to hold on to the original because it is a Warhol.","John may want to contribute to the relief efforts whether he knows about them or not, but he is $100 poorer without his knowledge.","I don't completely trust machines that haven't had a proven track record for a number of years. I would be afraid that something, anything could go wrong."
5f872793f61dbe0e27afda86,No,Worse off,No,"This is so funny. Nobody is better or worse off than anyone else, unless there is some unexplainable quality that Andy Warhol left. The hand of the artist is definitely real, but I don't believe here that it made any difference! They are not better off. ","If they told John, he would be better off and feel good about helping. But since he doesn't know, he just feels as though his taxes have been raise $100 and probably doesn't like that. ",I am too scared. Plus I have control issues. I also have trouble really believing that it would feel as real as real life because I have read enough dystopian novels. And I wouldn't like the experience of unplugging and realizing that it had all been fake. 
5589565cfdf99b6bd06016dc,Yes,Better off,Yes,"For the amount of money, this person is better off getting the original one.  It's no fun obtaining a fake item and overpaying for it. Authentic is a good feeling to know it is. ",It makes John better off because he feels good knowing that he's helping even if it is not.  It's the feeling that counts.  Feeling good is a win.  ,Sure because happiness is fleeting.  I want to experience as much happiness regardless if it's real or not.  The happiness part IS real while it's happening.  That's a good feeling.

Even if he voluntarily donated the money, he's still $100 poorer.  Worse off.","I've had a similar question before but involved getting into a dark tank filled with water.  That I would not do because dark and water does not appeal to me.  But unless I perceive the machine as being dangerous or too scary, would definitely do it."
5cadf2fa7e99a900171c4705,Yes,Better off,No,Because they have the real thing and not a counterfeit. Future technology may be able to differentiate even though current technology can't. ,"John would give the money if he knew, so its no hurting him financially.  I'm not sure Better Off is correct since he won't learn about this contribution, but its more correct than Worse off. ","I don't like the idea of being vulnerable and not knowing what was happening in the real world around me.  I wouldn't feel safe. Also, it seems like the addictive potential of this machine is high. "
6400d8fbeba2f9f8eb604b9a,No,Better off,Yes,"I think everyone is worse off in this scenario.  In this case it feels more like the world as a whole lost an original, not gained a number of copies.  ",Even if he is not directly impacted there may be a similar situation in the future that he can be assured he will be able to benefit from.  ,It would be an easy and presumably more affordable way to experience things I would otherwise never have a chance to.  
5cbe04b4f429ff00159de30e,No,Worse off,Yes,It is difficult for people to differentiate the real drawing from the fakes.,"It all depends on how John is currently doing financially at the moment, because we do not have this information, it is difficult to tell if he will be affected by this tax increase or not.","It would be motivating and inspiring to live in my ideal world, even for a few minutes."
5df3c82961b48a2907204173,No,Better off,Yes,"The person who got the original Andy Warhol drawing is not better off, as the original and the copies are indistinguishable.

The increased taxes align with his desire to contribute to relief efforts.",  I would go into the machine because I could have amazing experiences without any real worries or problems. It seems like a cool dream where everything I want happens.
627920bf48e6cf4191a98f65,Yes,Better off,Yes,"Since they will never learn which one is which, it doesn't matter. But you never know what will happen in the future, they might find a way to figure it out. ",His money goes to where he wants to be.,I want to experience things that I couldn't experience in real life.
62d22695270242b5b620ba4f,No,Better off,No,"Because there is no way to distinguish between a copy and the original, there is no meaningful distinction.","Because John would gladly contribute, John will not miss the money or experience it as a loss.  It will not worsen his life or be a hardship.",I think I would prefer to have an authentic actual experience over a simulated one.
643c3c95bad7ccbbd9672d8f,No,Worse off,No,"Since they will not ever know if they have the original, then they can just assume that it is the original and enjoy it. As there is no one to tell them the truth, then they are no worse off not knowing, because nothing is being intentionally withheld for malicious reasons.","Actually, it doesn't state what his financial situation is, so its neither worse or better off, as it is clear that he would support them with that money if he knew about it. The point, in my mind, is that he was not given that choice or told the truth about why he was being taxed. He should be informed so that he can know why he's being taxed and even opt to send an additional amount if he chooses.","I can create my own experience out of my strong imagination. I would not knowingly fool myself, even for a bit of fun. "
5848ad3bdb871400012da095,No,Worse off,No,They have an original that no one can tell it is one. This concept flooded the market with fakes so that all of them are worthless.,"I suppose it could help those people far away, but it does not directly help John. It just takes away what he has, that he could use for an emergency.","This sounds way to creepy. I would want a real experience, I would want to be there to feel it for real."
607134f478e13587bd89e13a,No,Worse off,No,Someone should be made aware of what they purchased.

I just know I'm uncomfortable with the machine.

I realize person doesn't know whether they bought original or copy, but if and when technology or some other means of authenticating the original becomes available, it would be highly desirable to have the original. BTW I think this social experiment is idiotic and irresponsible if they indeed no longer know which is the original. Surely the paper is different than the copies' paper.","Since John does not know what his $100 is going toward, he is worse off, since he is out $100 he could've spent on charitable contribution of his choice or on himself.

Also, while I may not 'know' what I am experiencing in the machine is not real at the time it is happening, afterwards there will be either and absolute 'knowing' that the experience was not real or a strong feeling of it.

However, if no one can tell the difference between the original and the copies, then the value of the original is essentially the same as the value of the copies.    In this case, the person who got the original drawing will not be able to sell it for more than the price of a copy. They may even have difficulty selling it at all, as buyers will not be able to be sure that they are getting the real thing.    Therefore, the person who got the original Andy Warhol drawing is not better off by getting it instead of a copy. They are essentially just getting a more expensive copy.","Even though John cares about helping others and would gladly contribute $100 to the relief effort, he will never learn about the flooding or the relief effort.

For example, he may have to cut back on his spending on food or entertainment.    Overall, the government raising taxes to provide financial relief makes John worse off, even though he is a caring person who would be willing to help others.","I would not go into the experience machine.    I believe that there is more to life than just pleasure and enjoyment. I want to experience the world and all that it has to offer, both the good and the bad.

They shape our character and our values. They help us to grow and learn. I would not want to miss out on these experiences, even if I could have them in a simulated reality.    I also believe that it is important to live in the real world. I want to connect with real people and make a difference in the world. I want to leave my mark on the world, even if it is a small one.    I believe that the experience machine would prevent me from doing these things.

5f8b022ec072cf1d32d4f0bf,Yes,Worse off,Yes,"From a financial standpoint, the person who got the original Andy Warhol drawing is better off. This is because the original drawing is worth $20,000, while the copies are only valued at $250 each. However, in terms of the aesthetic or artistic value, since the copies are indistinguishable from the original, both the original and the copies hold the same visual significance."," the government raising taxes to provide financial relief would make John worse off. Since John cares about helping others and would gladly contribute $100 to the relief effort, he would likely be disappointed to find out that he was indirectly taxed without his knowledge.

Anyway, I would say that no, the person with the real one is not actually any better off if truly no one will ever know the difference between the real fake ones. After all, even the people who got the fake ones have as much claim to potentially having the real one, plus the added novelty of being a part of the story. But as far as the scenario is explained, the real is indistinguishable from the fake as far as human perception goes (and obviously the utility of every copy is the same). ","Imposing the tax on John, even if he WOULD have donated the same money on his own, isn't the same process even if it's the same outcome. John might end up -$100 from where he started either way, but in this case he's being stripped of his liberty/agency/freedom here.","Yeah of course...I might regret it, that's a real possibility, but I don't see any disadvantage; I might hopefully learn something about the experience, or about my own behavior/myself in such an experience. I might even get over the novelty of the thing in question and therefore...not crave it so badly back in reality? There's a double-edged sword to being able to fulfill your fantasies like that, but ultimately I think i'm appreciative of the ones i have fulfilled and moved past."

I was going to say yes, because maybe eventually there will be a way to tell. Since they are indistinguishable and it wont ever be possible to know, then no they are not better off because no one will ever know which is real. In John's case, he received a negative thing which could have been offset with some simple knowledge. In this case, even if they got the original copy, they would never know it's an original so there will always be that thought in the back of their mind regardless of which they have.","I would say worse off because he sees it as a levy/tax without knowing what it is going towards.

I would rather the government cut down their own excessive spending to  free those tax dollars for emergencies.

My mom was Cuban, as am I, and more than anything in the world, I would love to go into that machine to make it as if I could spend just a couple more hours with her. She can boss me around again. I don't care. I miss her so much!"
55b16913fdf99b5daa0945aa,Yes,Better off,Yes,"From a human perspective, owning the original Warhol drawing holds inherent value due to its connection to the artist, its history, and the narrative that surrounds genuine artwork. Even if no one, including the owner, knows they possess the original, the very idea that they might hold something authentic adds a layer of intrinsic value and mystique to the piece, making their experience of ownership richer and more profound than if they were certain they had a copy.","The government raising taxes to provide financial relief makes John better off because, even without his knowledge, his innate value of helping others is being fulfilled. This aligns with his personal ethos, and if he were aware of the situation, he'd find contentment in knowing his contribution made a positive impact on those in need.","I might choose to enter the experience machine because it would offer a chance to live out my greatest dreams and desires without any risks or drawbacks, allowing me to experience a version of reality tailored to my utmost contentment."
610729d5507a50dd1db1246f,Yes,Better off,Yes,The value of an original work of art is not diminished by the number of copies in circulation. Not knowing the true value does not detract from that value.  A real diamond hidden in a pile of perfect fakes does not become less precious.,"By being part of a society that works to improve conditions for all, even by taking a bit from some to help others at times, every member of the society benefits. The next crisis could very well hit John himself, and he would then be on the receiving end.","Wow, what a GREAT question!! I suppose we could speculate that our lives might be exactly this... my spirituality/worldview has at times included just this idea, although when things are very difficult in my life (as they are currently) both my spirituality and worldview crumble under doubt and existential angst. sorry, tl;dr, lol!"
5efec82cf597a73e75e3fbe0,No,Worse off,Yes,"I feel as though the original deserves to be in the hands of someone who deserves it (family of the artist, etc.), or in the possession of an art gallery or museum.","Because John does not know about the flooding or the relief effort, the increased tax seems like more of a burden on John.","The Experience Machine almost seems like a step beyond VR headsets, which I am familiar with. Additionally, The Experience Machine may allow me to experience things I would never be able to experience in real life, and this may make me happier."
643edc41faeb4233074d9fce,Yes,Worse off,Yes,"I would always hope for the original one, for sentimental value",I feel it wouldn't be of benefit to John if he lives far away and won't really be impacted by it.,"Being that my life haven't been the best, right along in now I would go for anything that will show me some of my wishful thinking."
5e975ea254955d0bfe9f7929,No,Worse off,No,"No the person is not better off because the inherent value of the original has been destroyed by the counterfeiters. Everything that made the drawing unique has been mass produced. (Although, if the owner knew he/she had the original, they would know that Warhol actually touched and created the artwork, so that would indeed be special.)",John is worse off because he does not know that his increased tax payment is going to benefit others. All John knows is that he is  out $100 for no apparent reason. John does not have the satisfaction of knowing that his tax increase is for a very good cause.,"I would not because it would not be a genuine experience and I would be relinquishing control of my reality to a machine. That does not sound desirable at all. It sounds creepy and ""Matrix-y."""
5fd18d125e1f92195b1717bc,Yes,Worse off,No,"Yes, because if they get the real one they actually got their wish. If they got a copy, it would turn out they had a fake all along.","It makes it worse on people like John, because he has to spend money that doesn't help him.",I am not interested in augmented or virtual reality.

It would be a picture to enjoy.,This is difficult to decide because of the uncertainty of his finances.  Knowing he would give makes me say better off because of the joy it would give him.,"I think this could be a lot of fun to ""experience"" something you've dreamed about.  I think as long as you don't go ""crazy"" with your wish it could be a lot of fun."
62cd9b920ed1b7c1648818d3,No,Worse off,No,It will never be known that the original one is not actually a copy so it will never be more valuable than the others to anyone buying it. So the price for the original will never be higher than the price for any copy and no one will be better of (having anything more valuable than the others) by having it.,"It makes him worse off, because he has less money than before the taxes are raised plus he never learns the real reason for why they were raised, making him FEEL worse off too.",I would not care to have an experience that was not real but that I believed was real. 
6396831c7d4c5f44c1b16bf6,No,Worse off,Yes,He doesn't know if it's the original or a copy. He probably thinks it is a copy because those are the chances.,He doesn't know why - he just knows that he has to pay more taxes.,I can't think of a reason why I wouldn't. The experience would be desirable so I would enjoy it!
5d74001d391b6600175f433b,Yes,Worse off,Yes,"If they can prove they have the original, then yes, it's better to have the original because it will be worth more. The art market is all about which artist made something, even if it looks identical (or worse) to something done by a less known artist.","Technically worse off, because he will have less money, not receive tangible benefit from it, and not experience any warm fuzzies from helping others since he doesn't know what the money was for.",Yes but I think I would have to be very careful about how I use it. It would be too easy to never want to leave the experience machines and go back to real life.
5f7cea30ebb5ac1a8a11569a,Yes,Worse off,No,There is probably some way to tell which is the original or at least they can find a way to resell it for more cash.,"He doesn't know why the money is being taken from him, and just because he would be happy to help people doesn't mean he's always financially able too.",I would be forever paranoid about whether i left the machine or not.

5f72115608681e0d955ce243,Yes,Worse off,No,It is more likely to pass for resale if they choose to sell,He doesn't know why his taxes are being increased so he won't get the gratification of helping others.,This feels like something that would eventually lead me to question my own reality
5d23460ad4c57900192b129c,No,Better off,No,"They wouldn't be able to tell it apart from the copies anyway. Unless there was a REALLY good antique appraiser, and the scenario said no one could tell the difference, I don't think it would matter any. ","I think it makes him better off spiritually and ethically. I think he's happy to help people out and would feel good about the tax increase. I think, however, it might leave him worse off, financially.","I would have considered it, if I would actually know that I was in the machine. I think when the time came to exit the machine, reality might hit hard and really mess with your reality. It might end up being like a really weird dream inside the machine, but I think it would be too weird for me."
62e641e757a7c8640079fbd9,No,Worse off,Yes,"This person is not better off my getting a copy instead of the original. I believe this way because the buyer wants the drawing that was actually done by Andy Warhol, the buyer wants what the artist actually touched not what a computer touched and drew. ","I could make John worse off if he could not afford the extra $100, but the government can afford the extra $100. I do not understand why the government could not afford the extra $100 by cutting expenses on their end. ",There are things that I would love to do before my life is over. Unfortunately I do not make enough money to experience these things therefore the experience machine would allow to accomplish some of my goals before I die. 
5f969b802a498b000aab2571,Yes,Better off,Yes,I think participating in something like this would be mentally stimulating. You get both the enjoyment of the art and the socialization of contributing to something larger than an individual experience.,"If John is someone who holds the mindset of helping others as a positive experience, he likely also understands taxes as critical to funding infrastructure. I think he would feel fulfilled to know his taxes are being used for their intended purpose instead of on government waste.",I became physically disabled about a decade ago. I would be eternally thankful to re-experience life without those limitations even if it was only a brief mental break from reality.
5ac16e870527ba0001c1f27e,Yes,Worse off,No,They were able to obtain the original.,He has less money to live on and provide for himself or family.,I think that it would provide me with a false sense of meaning and dilute the real meaning of what it is to be alive.
5b15307351caaf0001228d9b,No,Worse off,Yes,because they will never know the true worth of it so they will get no benefit and assume that they have a copy,he would have no emotional benefit to losing the money every month so it would make him worse off,I would go in the machine because it would be pleasureable for me and I wouldn't know either way if it was real or not. To me it would be entirely real so it wouldnt matter.
5f7a28b8bedcf2112ebd1289,Yes,Better off,Yes,Nothing beats an original and I think anyone would appreciate an original.,"He is still helping people even if he is not aware of it. He seems to appreciate helping people and if he knew his money was going towards this, he would approve.","Right now, I could go for a vacation on a nice beach in the Caribbean (thinking Grand Cayman), so if I could go into machine and have that experience for a little while, it would mean a lot to me. I would hopefully feel refreshed once I got back to reality."
5fdac85f90a6137a11b4a415,Yes,Worse off,Yes,"The original one is going to be worth way more, so it would be an investment or something they would cherish more because it's the real deal.","I think that $100 is a lot of money and I think John might really want to use it, or need to use it on something for himself. He wouldn't know about what he was helping anyways.",I feel like this would be a cool experience. Doesn't seem like it would be a harmful one.
63ead665638c8546d8c3a962,No,Worse off,Yes,"They'll never know that they have an original one or not, so they wouldn't be better off.

5e41a52038926b03b5357afb,No,Worse off,No,It could be a 50/50 chance that it might or might not benefit him simply because he nor anyone else will know whether it is genuine or fake.,John was not effected by the levy and depending on his financial situation the tax increase might hurt him vs help him.,"If it is not real and I do not know that I am in it, it just does not make sense for me to be in that type of simulated reality."
5de1ac810f8b6721970ab78a,No,Worse off,Yes,"They spent $250. Maybe their drawing is genuine and worth $20k, but only if they can prove it. But nobody can identify the original. Therefore you have 999+1 drawings, each of which is worth $250, including the original. Financially they destroyed an original Warhol. ","Purely financially yes he is worse off as the government has pried another $100 out of him. It doesn't really matter who it is helping, it's not his job. The government is the one who should help, we all pay taxes for the benefits of living in this society and the support when things go wrong.","I have stage IV cancer.

63b6be87ead45e4fa772fbf5,No,Worse off,Yes,It doesn't matter cuz they will never know which they have received.,John would have less money to afford the things he needs and why should he be forced to pay for issues where he doesn't even live.,I all about new experiences and being daring
648786bd2c580f666fb051cd,No,Better off,No,they don't know if it's real or fake,"it doesn't bother john so i guess john can afford it, and he would help if he knew about it",i wouldn't trust the machine. i wouldn't want to play with my mind like that.
60fcf983b8bc5ffc2e7f793c,Yes,Better off,Yes,"If he tried to resell it, he would not make any money. Surely someone can distinguish the fakes within the art world. ","You could argue that it's $100 he could use on something else more directly beneficial, but it sounds like he'd feel fulfilled if he KNEW it was helping people. Plus, the money will ultimately help his community, which will result in better outcomes for everyone in the community.","Because an experience is still an experience, I think I'd still be happy having experienced it. "
6107acfe97c63575a2344e36,Yes,Worse off,No,They ended up getting an original for a good price.,It would be different if he was aware of the tax and willingly gave $100 but he's not so I feel he is worse off.,I would rather live real life than be in a simulated reality.
55a28851fdf99b602e6b05dd,No,Worse off,No,"No, since no one will ever know it is the real one, so its value will always be the same as all the others.",John is worse off  because his taxes have increased so he has less money.,I can imagine becoming so addicted to an experience machine that real life would become impossible. I would rather not start down that road.
5e29dc4721a5f20481c70274,Yes,Better off,No,I think the original is better because eventually someone may be able to authenticate it.,I think even though it is money out of his pocket in the long run it will benefit others and he cares about helping others.,I would rather go in real life and have these experiences. 
5dd2bdc1fbb5733c293e6c6e,Yes,Better off,No,"This is the hardest question yet and I'm disturbed that someone did that and created so many forgeries.  But deep down I think the original is the best, and that person is better off for getting it.","Because John cares about helping others, and helping people helps us.",I would not go in it.  I want the experiences that I have to be actual real experiences involving real people.
5dc4c22f0389e438ac69eac9,No,Better off,No,The person will never know whether they have the original copy because all the copies are the same as the original. It's better to just have the fake copy because they are indistinguishable. ,"Although John doesn't stay near the town that had the massive flooding, the tax increase and John's $100 contribution helps aid towards relief efforts while helping others. ",I would not go into the machine because I believe that a simulated reality would be too much for me to handle. What can be achieved in the simulation may be achieved in real life. 
5b7aefd06c1ccb000178b710,Yes,Better off,No,"In the future, we might have better technology to detect fakes. So, the person who got the original drawing will be better off because he will be able to sell it for a lot of money when it is authenticated as real. ","John might be paying more taxes, but he will ultimately be better off with the government helping families get relief from the flooding because we live in a society and we should help people. John will be helped by having a better society and having a government that makes people's lives better.","I prefer to have real experiences.

5db0a97f127d4000117cdfa0,No,Worse off,No,Because they don't know that they have an original Andy Warhol.,It should be his choice on whether or not he contributes to the flood relief effort. The government shouldn't just take it.,I don't like the idea of the alternate reality.
5f556bd46e6c4c93a5a90c77,Yes,Worse off,Yes,"Yes, because owning the original Andy Warhol drawing provides a unique and potentially valuable connection to the artist's work.",The government's decision to raise taxes for financial relief makes John worse off because he ends up paying an additional $100 without being aware of the flooding or the relief effort., I prioritize the immediate and constant experience of happiness and pleasure over the authenticity of real-life experiences and the challenges they might bring.
646619d0918746fb726da63e,Yes,Better off,No,"It's a matter of integrity, ethics and honesty.

There are some experiences that would be cool to have that I either cannot do in real life or do not want to take the risk
5dd5fdd811b0bd5ac65a9b3a,Yes,Worse off,No,"I mean if they truly want to know if they have the original then they can have the paper tested and it would completely be worth it to the person who got the original. If I thought I had a fake it would not get the same treatment as a confirmed original & there again, if someone truly values a Warhol then they are absolutely better off getting the original.","While I have no problem with they levy itself, for people like John knowing that they are helping would be very beneficial. It would provide him some peace of mind and comfort to know that he was doing something to help & if he ever found out about the flood he could easily fret & worry over not being able to do something. Sometimes that comfort and peace of mind is invaluable.","That's an incredibly difficult one because then I could have more time with my son & my dog that passed away. However, before and after I would know and I truly believe that would make the experience hollow & kind of empty when I returned to reality."
62faba5f904642df812944fa,Yes,Worse off,Yes,"Eventually, there may be a technology to distinguish the difference and there is a huge difference between 20K and $250. It's very sad though that this is already probably a big business.",It doesn't seem fair that he wouldn't know what the $100 tax was going towards.,I'm inclined to say yes but am concerned about not knowing I'm in the machine. 
622f7f35376a1f92763ddbe2,Yes,Better off,Yes,"There were only 1,000 copies made of the original, so any of them could probably be resold for a profit.","John is unaware of it, but this tax will help other people who have undergone a bad weather-related experience.",I had a very traumatic experience when I was a young adult. I think that maybe experiencing a different outcome of that ordeal would help me in an emotionally healthy way.
623537f22ffeb94d58da7a10,No,Worse off,No,Because no one can tell the difference they all are going to be worth the same.,Because even though he would have done it on his own he is still out the money.,I would not go in because when I came out and realized it was not real I would feel disappointed. 
62bb42e2f21cfdb280cc975f,Yes,Better off,Yes,The original itself is really priceless.,I think he was a bit sidetracked over getting charge but he was ultimately happy to help out. ,I'd like to experience something phenomenal like this.
6129cc7a565c9c03752802fa,Yes,Worse off,Yes,I think there's something poetic about having the original without really knowing they do,i think John would want to feel in control of his donation and the impact his money has,I would because i like having experiences without always having to worry about consequences
5765b92cf96b100001f64c9a,Yes,Worse off,Yes,Because they were expecting to get the original copy. ,That money can go to something else. And he should be the one to decide where his money goes. ,I would want to experience some things that I know that I won't have a chance to experience in real life. 
6402618738abc106f32f8928,No,Better off,No,"If the person doesn't know whether it is the original or not, it's irrelevant. I think there is an ethical concern of copying a piece of art created by an artist, forging copies, and selling them without the buyers being aware of the authenticity of the art they purchased. On the other hand, there is some merit to the idea of subverting the bourgeoisie idea that a piece of artwork has an overinflated value. ","From a philosophical standpoint, I find the idea that John should be taxed as an individual citizen as opposed to requiring corporations to pay a fair share of their taxes infuriating. I'm perfectly happy to pay taxes for services I may never use because it makes our society a better place. John would be better off because improving the quality of life for the general population is a benefit to us all. ",I find the idea that I could experience something that isn't real without being able to distinguish that simulated experience from reality disturbing.

643edca8dcd599c6fba5e31b,No,Worse off,Yes,Because since it's indistinguishable from the fake ones people would probably be reluctant giving him $20k for it because they wouldn't be certain it was the real thing.,I say worse off because John is being deceived in a way.,Because it would give me the opportunity to experience what it would feel like to have something that I really desire.
62c97a70d02df972bdfc2718,No,Worse off,Yes,The value is questionable given the number of fakes created and lack of ability to validate the original. All are equally worthless.,John was forced to pay taxes and really received nothing in return nor did he have any say in how that money was used.,"Yes because it depends wasn't an option and there are several other factors that might influence my choice. Since the decision was binary, I lean toward yes because I take risks."
6104b1c50f6057c1d8a6e3a6,Yes,Worse off,No,Maybe the ghost of Andy Warhol is happy that his work wasn't completely gone.,It would impact him financially but not enough to really put him in any danger since he was willing to contribute charitably to the floods.,Experiencing all that pleasure and then returning to reality would be incredibly depressing.
631c8e97db06f601f81bd82f,Yes,Worse off,Yes,Because I feel like the original copy is much better!,since they are technically dealing with more taxes.,I feel like I would be willing to try this out because it sounds cool.
5dd00a19b51b3e103a6f50c8,No,Better off,Yes,"Since the information about the original and its copies is publicly available, the value of the original is lost because it can never be recovered for certain.

5d41df0ca7b5800001a0341a,Yes,Worse off,No,They're better off getting the original art piece because that's what they intended to buy - an authentic work of art by a famed artist. I sincerely doubt they would feel differently if they paid $20K for a fake.,"I believe it may make John worse off financially because I don't know the state of his finances or household budget (i.e., can he afford the higher taxes and levy?).","The experience is not genuine and for that reason, I would pass on it.

63804d105c37525d499b9c6c,Yes,Worse off,Yes,This person is totally better off getting the original instead of the copy because the person now has an Andy Warhol original which is desirable. This is totally worth so much more than the $250 the person paid.,"Even though John would contribute $100 to the relief effort, since it doesn't even know that his $100 actually when to it, he probably would feel worse off, not having that $100 that he had before being taxed. He doesn't know that his $100 actually went to something he would contribute, so he is worse off because he didn't get to make that choice directly, personally, on his own.","Since I don't know the machine is simulating a real experience, I would totally enjoy the experience, thinking it was real. I would feel it was a unique, one in a lifetime experience and just participate in it wholly."
56610c81b018d100126e5da9,Yes,Better off,Yes,I think the original holds more value because it was originally completed by the actual artist himself. Not by a robot or others.,"John doesn't mind the raising of the taxes. If he did, it'd be a different story. He loves to help and doesn't mind the tax.",This would be the opportunity of a lifetime.

614df320ea8a021fd05d22da,No,Better off,Yes,"Rather than there being 1 original copy of the drawing, there is now an indistinguishable original amongst 999 copies that are perfect replicas of the original and indistinguishable. The value of the original is lowered because of this and no one will ever be able to verify the authenticity of the original.","Though John will never learn about the flooding or the relief effort and he will be paying/losing $100, he is better off because it is likely that if there is an event that leaves him devastated or homeless his government will enact a similar relief effort that will help him.","I would go in knowing it was probably a bad idea, but unable to resist because the opportunity is insane and it opens up a whole new world that will impact your future. "
5ed3055d98e33f182062933b,Yes,Worse off,Yes,Because the original is still much more valuable than the others.,Because he is paying money and does not know why so he cant experience being part of helping the people affected.,Id love to try experiences that I might not be able to have in real life.
60fd05d893767fcb40666fc7,No,Worse off,Yes,"If there's no way to ever tell, even by an expert, that the drawing they received is the authentic one, then they will never be able to sell it for profit, or have any pride in owning it.","I don't think he's really THAT worse off, but I do think that giving voluntarily is better than government mandated taxes, and in this case he would have made the right choice, but that choice wasn't given to him.","This actually reminds me of a book I read when I was young, ""The Reality Bug"" and even though the moral of that story was that plugging in to an alternate reality was damaging, it always sounded fun to me. I think life is hard enough and so many people lack real joy and positive experiences and this would be a way to have them."
5c560b6fccb08c0001e134a8,Yes,Worse off,No,It is worth more and legitimate because it is an original.,"I think the government is withholding information, so lying is a disadvantage.",It would heighten my anxiety.
6025b3681ff1521a3369dffe,Yes,Better off,No,because its worth more money than the copy,because john doesnt mind helping for others,because its scary as i wouldnt know i was in it because what if something bad were to happen and i would have no idea about it
64527892acde0fbd392a41d6,Yes,Better off,No,"He can sell it, and make a huge profit.",He's better off because he would have no problem contributing $100 if he knew about the flood. ,I am not a fan of simulated reality.
6098164e4c37ed73ca9c74f5,Yes,Worse off,Yes,"Although the person will never know that they got the original copy, there is something special about having an original piece of work, even if they don't know it.",John is now $100 poorer because of a flood he will never even know about.,I feel very unhappy and depressed in my real life so this machine could give me an escape. It would be a way to get away from my usual daily stresses.
62b33e2a447824fbd0770025,No,Worse off,No,"If the fake is indistinguishable from the original, it wouldn't really matter if you get the fake or not.",I think it's up to the people to donate resources to the needy if they want to.,Simulated reality kind of scares me. I prefer knowing that the reality I'm experiencing is actually *real*.
63192b009a902051e89fabf1,No,Worse off,Yes,Because the person can't distinguish the real one from fake therefore the original loses value,If his taxes are raised with no explanation he might feel worse off. If he knew it went to a good cause he would be better off.,You could experience a lot more then you can in your regular life and if you are unaware it isn't real why not.
5f29aed2c46fc6118f5980c3,Yes,Better off,Yes,"The person is better off, because even if they aren't aware of it, they received a one of a kind original. ","John has no idea about the floor or the government raising taxes, so he's not likely to be hurt by it. ","I think it would be an interesting experience. It's not real, so the likelihood of me being hurt is small. "
6444b1e677ebe8b4e2c23abd,No,Worse off,No,"Not better off, because he/she will never know for sure if they got the original.","John will not be happy about the $100 levy, because he did not know why he was levied. BUT if he had been informed about why he would have been happier and better off.","Because the experiences are not real, and I would not like to live in a machine forever."
6470a5eff2f118fd3e0385d5,No,Better off,Yes,Because the pictures are so close together that a distinction can't be made between the real and the fake so they probably wouldn't even know.,I feel that he would feel better about himself and be better off because he enjoys helping people and would have done it regardless.,I would enjoy to do things that I probably would not be able to in the real world.
63d53c0cab4782e305e343c4,No,Worse off,No,"The person who receives the original is not better off on a financial sense, as the value of the original has been diluted across all 1000 drawings. This makes it difficult to the person to realize the full potential of owning the original.","This effectively takes money away from John without him ever knowing. This situation could be seen as an ethical concern, as he would have been willing to contribute voluntarily if informed. ","This is a loaded question (I could feel brain cells buzzing and popping as I read this lol).   I want to keep what is in this dimension, in THIS dimension. Once the boundary is crossed, there would no longer be a guidepost distinguishing the perceived reality...the ending result could make one feel like they are going insane.   I'd rather sign up for a Ayahuasca trip to integrate this current reality and feel healthier in this body. "
63a4c930cad013279a39566c,No,Better off,Yes,Not really.  There apparently is no difference so they could believe whatever they choose about the artwork. A thing is only as valuable as one believes it is and is to them.,As John care about helping others and would happily give the $100 I believe mentally he would be uplifted by helping in this way even if all he knows is that the levy/contribution was made.  I've been given no reason to think this would be a burden or harm him financially so I can only guess he'd feel a better person for having contributed.,I wouldn't pass up an opportunity like that...to experience the scenario of my dreams? When does an average person living on a budget get to do something like that? Never--so I would jump at the chance; I could use a unique & immersive vacation.
63c1d50895843298a2267943,Yes,Better off,No,An original Andy Warhol drawing would be far more valuable than a forgery.,The levy might benefit John if it can be treated as a charitable deduction.,I would rather have a real experience than a simulated one.
558bbd56fdf99b2127e1f359,Yes,Worse off,No,"The person is better off getting the original because it is worth more. Even if the person isn't aware of the worth, it is still worth more.","It would make him worse off financially. The fact that he would gladly contribute if he knew of the relief effort, doesn't change the fact that he doesn't know. ","I wouldn't go in the machine because even without my knowledge of the events not being real, they aren't real."
5c748f00300d3d000126ef3b,Yes,Better off,No,"its the original, so it is worth more",it would go to a good cause that he supports,its not real
60fdce771ceebe2ff0194869,Yes,Better off,Yes,They have gotten an original artwork for way less than it is worth,"If John is part of the community, he will eventually benefit from the relief when he returns to this place.",I think it could be fun to experience things I have always wanted to but never had the chance.
604fc38a4de8e6e1e0e0ea7b,No,Worse off,Yes,"There is now no way to verify which is the original, so it inevitably has no resale value. As an artist myself the art is very rudimentary and easily replicated, so either way $250 was wasted.","John would have been willing to help, but the government forced him to help. This puts him in a worse position psychologically because suddenly he has this expensive levy for something he doesn't even understand the purpose of. At least if he'd been asked to donate he could be happy knowing his money went to a good cause.","This was a hard one, but the idea of tasting some of the foods I really loved that I can't eat now because of GI and autoimmune illness and allergies sounds amazing. Also no weight gain, I'm in."
576017836442fa0006cfb7cd,No,Worse off,Yes,"Because there is no way to tell them apart, so it really does not matter.","He does not know where his money is going, so he is not better off for it.",It would just be really cool to experience something like this!
60fce87b3beaa7a435f3f600,Yes,Worse off,No,Yes because the original actually holds value,John would be losing more money,The aftermath of this scenario does not seem enjoyable. It could cause a lot of psychological damage.
63bc9e8cd8106f8d94c636d4,No,Worse off,No,They will never know and it would suck to never find out.,Because if John ever finds out he might donate another 100$. This could mean overall 200$. John might not be willing to donate 200$,i'd be missing out on the real experiences I could be having outside of the machine.
579181fa913c71000197531b,Yes,Better off,Yes,"Hopefully there is a way to tell the original and it would be worth more money. But if they just want a picture for their wall I don't think it matters. The value of the original would be in the eye of the beholder, unless someone wants to offer a fair sum of money for it. ",This is tricky to answer since he won't know what's being done. I would hope this would put good karma out there and he would pick up on that. ,This sounds really interesting and I would like to try it. I am not sure if I would want to travel in time or space. 
646b776eca37542a899c1de5,No,Worse off,No,"Because they are paying money for the original, not to be lied to and receive some machine-generated copy.","Worse off because he is not doing if of his own will as he would like. In a way, his own money is being taken from him.",I have no interest in that kind of fake experience.
638e84c70418d8a2c0aa372e,Yes,Worse off,No,"Part of the value of a work of art is the connection to the artist. Warhol made multiples of his work, but that was done with his knowledge and under his direction. The copies made by the art collector loose that connection to the original artist.","John is out $100 and he might really need it for food. Even if he would gladly contribute to the flood relief efforts, he does not know why he is being taxed more. This may cause him unwanted, unneeded stress. ",I don't like the idea of experiencing something that is not reality. I would much rather stay in the real world at all times. 
55b6d0a4fdf99b437183f9b5,No,Worse off,No,Nobody knows whether they have the original or not so how could they be better off?,He would be financially worse off. He wouldn't feel better because he was unaware he had given anything.,I like to know what's going on around me and do not need to go into a machine which would deprive me of that.
5bfff7c02213be0001c2c7cf,No,Worse off,No,The person wouldn't know if it were real or fake because no one does. So even if they wanted to sell it down the line they would never get the amount that the original is worth.,I think it makes him worse off. He doesn't know where his money is going and it could gladly be avoided. He should have the power to decide if he wants to contribute.,"I wouldn't, I would not want to be sold a dream that is unlike my reality. I already live with depression and coming out of the experience machine would probably be bad for me afterwards."
