If you can't pick it out of a lineup how can it possibly have a different value?","He has just lost money for seemingly no reason, so he probably feels worse in addition to having less money. If the government told him that that is what the taxes were for, I think he would be fine.",I don't want to be able to just miraculously have whatever experiences I want. They would lose value for me.
55d4cb9158c35800113dc22e,0.0,1.0,0.0,Their assumption is that they bought the original to begin with. It wouldn't put them in a better or worse position.,It makes him better off because his contribution helped others even if he never found out about it. ," Even if I thought it was real, it didn't happen and once I'm out of the machine things in my life are going to trigger that the experience really didn't happen.

594936ad4152bf0001bfd5cd,0.0,1.0,0.0,"Again, this is reductive and depends entirely on this person's worldview and their view of art. I would say if you purchased one of these knowing the goal of the project then no, you would be no better off having the original because presumably that wouldn't be all that important to you if this was something you were interested in and supporting already.","I believe dividing this into John being ""better or worse off"" is reductive. Overall, if he enjoys helping others, I would say he is better off with the tax. ","It would not matter how ""immersive"" the machine was, the experiences would not be tangible or real. While I enjoy losing myself in games or books, part of that enjoyment comes from the fact it is fiction. I have no desire to experience that which isn't happening to me as if it were. "

In fact, the person who got the original may even be worse off, as they may be worried that they do not actually have the original and that they have been duped.","Even though John cares about helping others and would gladly contribute $100 to the relief effort if he knew about the flood, he will never learn about the flood or the relief effort. This means that he is being taxed without any benefit to himself.","I believe that there is more to life than just experiencing pleasure. I want to experience the real world, with all its ups and downs. I want to feel the pain of loss and the joy of love. I want to make a difference in the world and leave my mark on history. I believe that these experiences are what make life meaningful."

He would say yes if asked and he is at peace with that. ,It's an opportunity that would be rare and fascinating and I am at the stage in life (last stage) where I want to experience new and unusual things and learn as much as humanly possible for as long as I am here and have all faculties intact. 
5c8f224c9d2bff0001867ce2,0.0,0.0,1.0,"No, because the forgeries and the original work are identical, so the original work loses a lot of artistic and economic value.","Because the tax increase will have a negative impact on John's income over the next few months, making his economic situation only slightly worse.",I believe that entering this machine can be a truly rewarding and unique experience.

He would ""gladly contribute"" so he would likely prefer contributing directly to the cause, with the added bonus of including this donation on his taxes.","While I think this experience might be interesting, I much prefer engaging in the ""real world"" with real people and things.  That way, I get the mental, sensual and somatic experiences within the contexts of reality - not just mental."
