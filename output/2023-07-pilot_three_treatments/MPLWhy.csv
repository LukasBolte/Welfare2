The idea of a forged note from the author just felt so bizarrely repellent to me that I didn't think anyone should be given such a gift. In the case where he does know, I was going to pick the original notes no matter what, but I did consider picking the fake notes for the case where he doesn't know."

However, in the event that Alex does learn which version of notes he received, I wanted to make it ""worth his while"" with respect to cash received with the fake notes rather than the real notes, therefore I set a higher financial threshold.  In other words, I realize that in this case, Alex would ""know what he's missing"" if he got the fake notes, so I wanted to make it up to him financially."
