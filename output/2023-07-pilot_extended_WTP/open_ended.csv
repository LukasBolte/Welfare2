60528727a8bd70153578f03a,1.0,0.0,1.0,They are better off because if if they don't know it they were able to get a piece of art worth $20k for $250.,He is giving the govt 100 and who knows where that will actually trickle down to.,I would like to try it for the simple reason that I have never experieced anything like it before. I would like to to try it atleast once in life.
546f8a9cfdf99b4a593414ea,1.0,0.0,0.0,The original is worth considerably more than the fakes. ,"He is out $100 and since we don't know where he lives, it possibly could not benefit him directly. ",I would rather live my life than fake it.
5aad9c53c4914b0001a39659,0.0,1.0,1.0,"Because this person has entered, along with every other person involved,into something like a commercial art performance where all items, original and copies,now share equally in value.",Better of because whether he was conscious of it or not the tax payment was what he would have wanted,I may be in such an experience machine now and see no reason to avoid entering the machine again. I would be particularly desirous of entering the machine if at the finish I would know that it had been a simulation because it would be like living twice or living in two different worlds
608f2ebc23ba13416e9a7e57,1.0,0.0,0.0,"Yes they are, but this is so wrong. That piece of art needs to be treated with respect to its history. If the person who bought a copy doesn't know what they have it can end up being inadvertently damaged or lost.",Because they don't give him the ability to make that choice for himself or tell him. John might have gone beyond donating and volunteered his time if he had been made aware of the situation. ,Sounds a little too much total recall for me. Social media and online activities have already separated people a great deal. Real life experiences have more value to me. This would just be another way for people to be exploited and probably cause addiction issues. 
5f4d07b4fae27694de8f5af1,1.0,0.0,0.0,"They may not know now how to determine the real ones, but in the future they may and this person will benefit from having a real one.","John does not know where his money is going when he pays taxes. If he knew, he would feel better.",I want to truly experience things not only in my mind but in actuality.
63e2953c6c707d75ae5fcdd2,1.0,0.0,0.0,Hopefully someday technology will advance enough to where he does know he has an original Warhol.,"He's worse off because he's out $100 for what he thinks is just another BS tax. If he knew the money was going to help homeless families, at least he could get a little satisfaction.","Whatever desirable scenario I choose is going to be great while it's happening, but it's going to suck hard when the machine's unplugged. And that's reality. "
5f0d0bb334aaaf7151fee628,1.0,0.0,1.0,The value of the original is higher than the fakes and the fakes will eventually be discovered. ,He does not know where the money goes and will resent the increase. He may also donate additional money if he learns about the flood thereby paying twice. ,I could try out things in the machine I could not try in real life and understand if it's something I should pursue in real life. 
63e57f5b078c526e4fb9d370,1.0,0.0,0.0,"If they are able to distinguish that it is an original, that would be worth significant money. Although, if the forgeries are so good, it may devalue the original","If the tax increase isn't explained, then John will just become further upset. Also, once the government raises taxes once, the taxes tend to stay elevated. ","Because simulated life isn't life. If you want to experience something, go do it. Don't rely on virtual reality. "
5ac43d51a3ba7a0001b498d0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"They don't know it, but they have a valuable piece, and if they ever have it valued by a professional, theyw ould find it to be authentic and be aware of its real value.","It's money out of his pocket, he takes a loss, so worse off.","No, because once I came out of it I would no longer have or be experiencing whatever it was I so desired that I had to use the sim because I couldn't have it in real waking life."
5ead45a386fbbe3c8eebe510,1.0,0.0,0.0,Because If it somehow is distinguished that person can resell it for $20K.,He may eventually overtime need all the money he is losing on taxes to pay his bills.,I don't want that feeling of accomplishment or satisfaction unless its real or I earned It. It would be horrible when I am back in reality and lose that feeling the machine gave me it would be like waking up from a dream and losing everything.
6117efedb574017076d5b499,0.0,1.0,0.0,I think he would get the original one instead of a copy.,I think it is the best from the provided information.,I think it would not good for that I won't entered into it. If I was there I would not able to know I am there.
62c97585c81636f2f16fbbb0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"I would say they are not better off because no one, including them, know it is the original so it has no consequence on their life.","The raising of taxes may have helped the flood victims, but it did not directly make John better off.","I would not go into the machine because I prefer having my conscious reality instead of an artificial one. Even if I don't realize I'm in a machine, I would still rather have my bodily autonomy and make decisions for myself in the real world."
607de1d7c7cc25b639f63026,0.0,0.0,0.0,No one will know who actually  has the original so everyone would be worse off. The value then goes down.,"I don't think it leaves him better or worse off, but he should have been notified of the tax he has to be paying.",This sounds creepy. I would be scared to enter into something like that.
640d988c383c60ed564dd05e,0.0,0.0,1.0,"if there is no way to authenticate or tell that is the original, he is no better or worse off because he will never know what he has. ",Because he is down $100 with a valid reason for why his taxes are being raised. This will probably cause him to donate to less causes in the future because his taxes are so high and might change the way he votes in the future. ,"I am disabled and I would love to experience certain normal or adventurous things that I can no longer do. Also having lost friends and loved ones, I would love to be able to go back and speak to them. I would also love to be able to experience my career as a firefighter again. I would also like to experience how my life would be if I took one of two career paths, I think that might help motivate me to accomplish my dream when things get hard. "
633e64bfaab0e4bed6e5307d,1.0,0.0,1.0,"Definitely better off. Even though they may not know it, they had a large chance of getting conned, but did not. ","No doubt, worse off. No matter the circumstance, everyone should know both why and where their hard earned dollars are going. ","I probably would go in the machine for the sole fact that you could experience the world without having to worry about travel or money. I, for one, would use it to tour a fantastic country like Australia or Europe. "
62bf0e174650375f525c21bf,1.0,0.0,0.0,"Outside of getting an original for an incredible discount, this person wanted a Warhol and they received it. That said it will be borderline impossible to know if its real or not.",There is a large chance that John would have provided more support had there been reporting on the flooding and relief effort.,"Life is unfortunately more than the pursuit of success. Building fake success with the assistance of a machine that would not allow you to fail. Anything you did would have a positive outcome. Bad business choices, infidelity, excess use of drugs and alcohol. No problem."
612323ddbebadb638a141ce3,0.0,0.0,0.0,"No, they don't know it is the original and with so many more fakes, I don't think anyone will buy it from them not for 20k ","It makes him worse off because to his understanding he only got taxed an extra $100. He doesn't get to feel like a good person by helping the relief effort, or be assured that his tax money is well spent ",I would be to afraid my real life wouldn't be good enough after experiencing something so perfect and immersive. Like maybe I would be depressed to live my life afterwards 
63f7823635eaa68f32130a14,1.0,0.0,0.0,I'd rather have the real one than a fake.,John would have donated if given the chance but instead the government is forcing John to pay taxes and he doesn't get to see what happens to the money after it leaves him.,I'd rather live real life with all the ups and downs than experience only good.
6397bcc95a5e903a262566bb,0.0,0.0,0.0,That would depend on if the general public was aware that there were all these fakes out there or not. An original only has the meaning that we assign to it. Without knowing whether or not you have the original you are unable to appreciate its meaning and value. ,It would make him worse off due to his dislike for paying taxes. Will only erode and chip away at his trust and overall feelings with the government. ,No I don't believe so. But my real answer is more like maybe but probably not. I don't know. Id have to be presented with the real possibility and give it serious thought. I have many reservations about such an idea though.

63b63938dbf229f3eb46d4a4,1.0,0.0,1.0,I just feel that way. let's chalk it up to gut instinct.,They took $100 from John that makes him worse in this very simplistic scenario in which I don't look too deeply into the existential question of the meaning of better off. ,"Yes if there was a machine that could completely replicate an experience and I'd never not know it wasn't real sure, sign me up. I'll try it once."
5fa17ddeabc188288bde81c8,1.0,1.0,1.0,they received a piece of art that they wanted.  Regardless of whether it is a fake or an original.,It allows for people to recover quicker and provide a more sound infrastructure that John lives in.,"Depending on what I could experience, I would see this as a learning opportunity for either my personal edification to understand things I don't know now.  If I have the genuine feelings and thoughts of the experience, I don't think it would matter if it was real or not.  Although there is quite of bit of potential problems where the system could be abused."
5b5b6c11f5bc590001177815,1.0,1.0,1.0,Because the original is worth more money,Because it would go to flood relief even though he does not know about it,I think I would go into it just to try it .

Even if they did have a $20,000 artwork originally it doesn't matter anymore because 999 other people have the exact same thing and the new market value price is $250. ",Because John seems like a person who likes to help out his fellow citizens. ,"Absolutely, because I'm an adventurous person and I love the idea of quantum jumping, parallel realities and VR experiences.
