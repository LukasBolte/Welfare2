Study title: Forecasting experimental participants' value for satisfying preferences when beliefs are fixed.



Principal investigators: Gonzalo R. Arrieta and Lukas Bolte



Description: We are researchers at Stanford University and Carnegie Mellon University running an incentivized experiment to investigate whether and how much people value satisfying others' preferences when the others' beliefs about whether those preferences are satisfied are fixed and won't change. In this study, we ask you to predict our main outcomes. Participation should take about five to ten minutes.


Risks and benefits: This is a minimal-risk study. We cannot and do not promise or guarantee that you will receive any benefits from participating in this study.



Confidentiality: We will not collect any personal identifiers during the course of this study. 



Contacts and questions: If you have questions about your rights as a research participant or are not satisfied with how this research is being conducted, you may contact the Stanford University IRB at irb2-manager@lists.stanford.edu or the Carnegie Mellon University IRB at irb-review@andrew.cmu.edu to speak to someone independent of the research team.



Consent: Being in this study is voluntary. Please exit the webpage if you do not want to participate. By clicking “I agree” below, you confirm that you have read the consent form, are at least 18 years old, and agree to participate in the research.","Consent study number: Stanford University's IRB protocol 44866 and Carnegie Mellon University IRB's #IRBSTUDY2015_00000482.
