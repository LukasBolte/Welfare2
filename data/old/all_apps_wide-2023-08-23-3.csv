In this case, the person who got the original drawing will not be able to sell it for more than the price of a copy. They may even have difficulty selling it at all, as buyers will not be able to be sure that they are getting the real thing.    Therefore, the person who got the original Andy Warhol drawing is not better off by getting it instead of a copy. They are essentially just getting a more expensive copy.",,,,,,,,"  Thank you for the opportunity to participate in this study. I found the instructions to be clear and easy to understand. I was also able to understand what I was asked to do. I was satisfied with the study overall and felt that the payment was appropriate.    Here are some comments on the study:    I think the questions were well-designed and thought-provoking. They made me think about the value of authenticity and the role of money in our lives.  I also appreciated the fact that the study was designed to be neutral and objective. The researchers did not try to influence my answers in any way.  Overall, I thought this was a well-conducted study and I am glad that I was able to participate.  Here are some suggestions for improvement:    I think it would be helpful to provide more context for the questions. For example, in the question about the experience machine, it would be helpful to know why the person is choosing to plug in. Are they looking for pleasure and enjoyment? Are they trying to escape from reality?  It would also be helpful to provide more options for the answers. For example, in the question about the flood in Arkansas, it would be helpful to have an option for the person to be indifferent to the tax increase.
